This one appears tame, smith said,
But could be dangerous because wild animals are unpredictable. People should not
Approach it, nor should they run away from the animal since that could provoke a
Chase. The best thing to do is ignore it, keep away from it and call the
Authorities, he g to tales circulating the wooded neighborhood off, the animal
Walked up to a man as he was swinging his toddler in the back yard. The cat is
Said to have lunged at the child. As the story goes, the man fended it off with
A chair, his wife grabbed their child, and they ran into the house. The cat sat
On their back deck for a while looking in, just like at the in another tale on a
Different street, a teenage baby sitter was at the backyard pool with an
8 - year - old boy and his cousin. The cat sneaked up on them from behind, and she
Jumped into the pool with the boy. They swam to the other side, but it followed
Them. They all ran into the house, and the cat sat looking in the door.
