Red bank, n. J., aug 24, 2004 (primezone
Via comtex) - - the following is a letter from john
Figliolini, president of atlantis business development
Corporation, inc. (otcbb:). Ldgkcpf
Dear shareholder, addlrko
I am writing to you today to
Discuss the new direction which your company will be
Heading. Up until this point we made it clear that
Abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of
The market. Our basic premise was to seek out
Companies that can be turned into positive cash flow
Businesses with the proper equity investment made into
Them by abdv. Fine wein records is an example of that;
With a financial commitment of $250, 000 by abdv we
Expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant
Positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the
Various projects they are currently working on.
E - direct is another example; we should start to see
Some meaningful positive cash flow developing and
Continuing over the next 12 months. However, abdv has
Not maintained a particular industry focus. As of
Today that has changed. Wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir
Last week we announced that abdv
Will be providing $1, 000, 000 in equity financing to
Future quest, inc. (pink sheets:),
A company in the oil gas sector, this was the start
Of our new direction. Abdv will be dedicated in
Locating and provide managerial, accounting and
Financing for companies in the energy field, from oil
And gas companies to alternative energy companies. Jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft
You may ask; why the energy
Related field? Simply it currently offers many
Opportunities and with the price of oil approaching
$50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth
To be made in this sector. According to adjusted
Inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak
Of $73 from the 1970 s. However, unlike the oil crisis
Of the past, we are looking at what will be a problem
To stay with us for a long time. Simply put the demand
For oil world wide has increased by some 2. 5% this
Year alone, most of which is because of china. The
Increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the
Bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $20 - 30
Level. We are looking at a trend that is now cemented
In stone. There are more players in the world economy
Today that require oil gas to propel their own
Economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at
These higher levels. Abdv has already aligned itself
With individuals that have experience in the energy
Field. These individuals will help locate viable
Opportunities and the funding necessary to participate
In these opportunities. Wtxrxayfisoira
So what do we do with our
Non - energy related businesses such as fine wein
Records and e - direct? Well, first of all we will
Continue to incubate and nurture these businesses
Until they are at a level where they can move on their
Own. I believe that both of these companies will be
Strong viable businesses in 12 months from now. At
That point I will recommend to abdv' s board of
Directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our
Shareholders. This strategy is in keeping with the
Basic premise of our business module whereby we share
The wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing
Public our portfolio companies. We can then continue
To concentrate in the energy - related field. Lvxhkmblmcewrw
By concentrating on a specific
Sector such as the energy area we will be able to
Define abdv' s purpose and guide it like a laser. Our
Goal will be to locate and make investments in no less
Than four energy - related businesses over the next 12
Months. I believe that by maintaining this focus an
Investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative
Way to participate in the booming oil gas and
Energy - related fields. Twqssqlqqkvbdm
