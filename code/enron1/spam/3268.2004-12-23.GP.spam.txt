About istorage networks:
Istorage networks, inc. Develops and markets network storage solutions that are specifically designed for the small to medium business. Computer activity has obviously grown over the last few years, especially driven by electronic mail (e - mail). This demand is further propagated by digital photos, video files and new high image applications. Federal requirements for audit trails, medical records and as well as security, add to this acceleration for the need of network storage capacity. Istorage with its expertise and experience in the worldwide storage industry, coupled with its technology and channel partners, can deliver products that are simple to use and affordable to meet these needs.
Istorage products utilize a new and emerging technology called iscsi. Iscsi, is an ip (internet protocol) based standard for linking data storage devices over a network and transferring the users data. From the storage side, iscsI uses the scsI command set, the core storage commands used throughout all storage configurations. On the networking side, iscsI uses ip and ethernet, which are the basis for most corporate networks. This revolutionary technology utilizes a standard disk drive interface and internet communications techniques, and provides an easy method for user' s to manage data.
The purchase orders have been issued through the company' s international resellers for projects in the automotive manufacturing and petrochemical refinery industry. These orders are the result of our efforts to date in developing the worldwide sales channel for our product offerings, said roger kirkland, vp sales and marketing for istorage. He also added the company is well positioned to support the growing marketplace in the small to medium business sector. These orders are for immediate shipment
