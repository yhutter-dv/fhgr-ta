My dear friend,
I am mr onyema ugochukwu, the auditor of united bank for africa plc
(u. B. A). I have a confidential business suggestion for you. One of our
Clients/personalfriend, late mr. Kim sean unfortunately lost his life
In the plane crash on january 31 st 2000 including his wife and his only
Daughter.
Late mr. Kim sean is a foreigner and the manager of granite minning
Nig, a chemical engineer by profession and he died since the year 2000.
No other person knows about this account or anything concerning it.
After further investigation it was also discovered that mr. Kim sean' s next
Of kin is his daughter who died with him, hence the account has no other
Beneficiary and my investigation proves to me as well that his company does
Not know anything about this account and the amount involved is us $65 million.
I am contacting you to stand and act as the next of kin to mr. Kim
Sean. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the
Total amount, while 60% will be for me, and any expenses which you and
Me may incur during the process of this transaction will also be reconciled
Afterwards.
Let me have your confidential telephone, fax and mobile numbers. My
Private email is: (mronyemaugochukwu 2@ ureach. Com)
