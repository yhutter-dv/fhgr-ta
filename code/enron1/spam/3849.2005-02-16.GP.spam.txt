Playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st. Louis this weekend, appeared on
Its way to retaking the lead. But a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
Flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
Would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning.

Get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season.

Movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat.

Wounded.
In a pamphlet distributed after the
Attack, hamas said it had used 1. 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
The incident.
