Subject: security alert on microsoft internet explorer
Dear suntrust bank customer,
To provide our customers the most effective and secure online access
To their accounts, we are continually upgrading our online services. As
We add new features and enhancements to our service, there are certain
Browser versions, which will not support these system upgrades. As many
Customers already know, microsoft internet explorer has significant' holes'
Or vulnerabilities that virus creators can easily take advantage of.
In order to further protect
Your account, we have introduced some new important security standards
And browser requirements. Suntrust security systems require that you test
Your browser now to see if it meets the requirements for suntrust internet
Banking.
Please sign
On to internet banking in order to verify security update installation.
This security update will be effective immediately. In the meantime, some
Of the internet banking services may not be available.
