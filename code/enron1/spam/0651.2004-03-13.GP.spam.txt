During the past year, over 20 additional biosphere process systems have
Been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over
$100 million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements
Include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the
Future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary from
Hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this

Electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government
With annual sales of $800 million. Tetra tech will coordinate the securing of
Necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the
Biosphere process system for leth. Tetra tech is now in the process of
Obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the
Biosphere process in the state of louisiana. This is a monumental event for
Leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana
While having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near -
Term announcement.
Stock set to explode on earnings boom:
Leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to
Achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company' s
Breakout year. The added kicker is that leth has historically released
Batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully
Completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that pattern is
Repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very
Big surprises still to come. There aren' t any companies at any price level
With the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth, while
Simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global
Demand to solve two crisis areas, waste and electrical energy, reaches
Unprecedented levels.
