Subject: urgent assistance
Good day,
I am kingsley muntu, decillion finacial services south africa. This is an urgent and confidential business proposition.
On june 14, 2000, a foreign consultant with the global oil corporation,
Mr. Alan baker made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar
Months, valued at us $8, 320, 000. 00, with us. Upon maturity. I sent a routine
Notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, a
Reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his contract employers,
Global oil corporation that mr. Baker passed away.
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a will
Or a testament, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that mr. Baker did not declare any kin or
Relations in any of his official documents, including his deposit paperwork
In my possession. This has been fixed under our management. No one will ever
Come forward to claim it.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand
In as the beneficiary to this investment. I am writing to you because i
Cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the beneficiary
Of the funds so that you claim on my behalf with the help of my attorney.
Please provide me with your full names and address so that my attorney
Prepares the necessary documents, which will put you in place as the
Beneficiary to this investment.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this
Transaction will be of mutual benefit, as you will be entitled to 30% of the money and the remaining 70% for my own investment. If you are
Interested, reply me by email for further details.
Kind regards,
Kingsley muntu.
