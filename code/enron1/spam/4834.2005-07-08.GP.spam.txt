Dear sir,
My name is basheer mohammed said bsharat (jnr) and I am a 24 yrs old
Jordain on exile in dubai, uae. I write you because I need urgent help.
My father is late basheer mohammed said bsharat who before his death
Was a major oil merchant in my country jordan.
I believe my father was murdered by his jealous brothers who at the
Moment are after my life too. I own a trust fund which my father
Opened for me in one of the big arab banks in jordan but I cannot
Access thisfund because I am not old enough yet.
I need an older person to pose as my guardian so that I can collect
This fund before my uncles see me and make me sign documents that i
Do not want to sign.
I will disclose the bank, account details and amount to anyone who can
Help me secure the release of this fund. It is all that I have left.
I will send my positive identification i. E my international
Passport copy and drivers license to prove that I am who I say I am.
I await your positive response.
Basheer
