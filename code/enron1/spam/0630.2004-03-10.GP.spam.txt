Will be very honest, committed and capable of assisting in this business venture.
Firstly, let me explain the source of this funds and what you are expected to do. A forigner late engineer theophilus baker, an oil merchant/contractor with the government of nigeria, until his death, over a year ago, was a victim ofa kenya airways: bus (a 310 - 300) flight
Kq 430 plane crash. The deceased, engnieer theopilius baker, banked with us and has a closing balance as a july 2000 worth $4. 5 m (four million five hundred thosand usd). Which my bank, now expectes a next - of - kin
To claim as the beneficiary of the funds, efforts has been made by union bank of nigeria to get in touch with the baker' s family or relative but to no success.
Based on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate engnieer theopilus' s next - of - kin, the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown
Account.
It is based on this that we have contacted you to stand as the next - of - kin of late engr. Theopilus baker so that the funds, will be released and paid into your account
As the beneficiary and the next - of - kin to the deceased. All documents, and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as we have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account.
