HI varou,
Some of you have been waiting for the" perfect" time to conquer your anxiety. You may be saying to yourself." I can' t tackle my anxiety right now. I' ll wait until my symptoms aren' t so strong to make changes in my life." or." i' ll start making changes when my life is less hectic." the list goes on and on.
