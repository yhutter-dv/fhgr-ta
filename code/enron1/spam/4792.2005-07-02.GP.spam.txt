Subject: healthy reproductive analysis
I just wanted to write and thank you for spur - m.
I suffered from poor sperm count and motility. I found
Your site and ordered spur - m fertility blend for men.
I have wondered for years what caused low semen and sperm
Count, and how I could improve my fertility and help my wife
Conceive. Spur - m seems to have done just that! Thank you
For your support.

Spur - m really does help improve fertility and effectiveness
Of sperm and semen motility. I used it for the past few months,
And not only does it work - I also feel better to. I have
More energy. This is an excellent counter to low sperm count
And motility. I' ll be buying more!!!

I had been wondering on the causes of low semen and
Sperm count, I was searching for this type of information
When I found your site. I hadn' t been made aware of this
Product before then, so was quite surprised to be able
To find a male fertility product. Usually everything is
Geared towards female fertility. Suffice to say I ordered
And a few months later we received the good news from the
Doctors - my wife is pregnant. I can' t be 100% sure if
It was spur - m that helped. But I am happy enough to be able
To say it should be considered by any man looking to increase
His fertility. It worked for me. Thanks.
