Dear sir
Re: joint venture.
I would like to apply through this medium for your co - operation and to secure an opportunity to invest and do joint business with you in your country.
I have a substantial capital I honorably intend to invest in your country into a very lucrative venture of which you are to advise and execute the said venture over there for the mutual benefits of both of us. Your able co - operation is to become my business partner in your country and create ideas on how money will be invested, probably managed and the type of investment after the money is transferred to your custody with your assistance.
Meanwhile, on indication of your willingness to handle this transaction sincerely by protecting our interests and upon your acceptance of this proposal, I would furnish you with the full detailed information, procedure, amount involve and mutual agreement on your percentage interest or share holding for helping me to secure the release of the deposit and investing the
Money.
I shall be glad to reserve this respect and opportunity for you, if you so desire, but I do urge you to give the matter your immediate attention it deserves.
Looking forward to your response.
