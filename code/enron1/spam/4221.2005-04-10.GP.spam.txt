There are some very positive news expected next week so act before that:)
About the company:
60 - million americans are losing - or have already lost - their hair. They are
Mostly men, but also a substantial number of women. Most of that 60 - milloin wish
They had it back. Gulf biomedical corporation (gbic) has a breakthrough product
That will help them. No, it will really help them.
There are thousands of products and services promising to do the same thing,
Until you read the fine print. The fine print says," this doesn' t work for
Everybody." it says," results may take four months or more to appear." it says,
" beware of the side effects." it says," a long term contract is required."
Gbic has hairmagict. There is no fine print. Hairmagict says, plain and simple:
" hairmagict grows hair. Easily. Painlessly. Inexpensively - for less than $2 a
Day. Results in 4 weeks, or your money back."

The product:
The product is hairmagictand it grows hair. No, it really grows hair. How
Important is that?
An estimated 60 million american men and women (yes, women too) are losing - or
Have already lost - their hair. Most of them would give anything to have it
Back. People do ridiculous things to look like they have hair when they really
Don' t. Funny? Sure, if you have a full head of hair. If you don' t, you would
Probably pay any amount for something that could actually grow hair on your
Head.
That' s what the experts call a" market!"
Now, you' ve seen all the ads. They are full of hair - growing promises, plus
Warnings that their product doesn' t work for everybody, and beware of the side
Effects. One promises the buyer will see results, if any, in four months. All of
Them cost a veritable fortune.
Now, finally, there' s a hair - growing product that actually grows hair, and
Hairmagict guarantees to start doing so in 4 weeks or less, or give you a 100%
Refund. And, incredibly, hairmagictsells for less than $2 a day.
