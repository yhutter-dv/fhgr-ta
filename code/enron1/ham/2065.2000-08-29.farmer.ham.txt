Subject: alloc. Except - mtr 1491
Daren,
Meter 1491 has steady flow for the first 13 days of the month. It is the
ShanghaI energy gas lift sales mtr. Previously, these volumes have been
Placed on the strangers agreement, but, I don' t know that that is correct.
The volume is steady between 150 and 200 per day. If I should be asking
Someone else, please let me know.
Thank you for all of your assistance and patience,
Mary jane
