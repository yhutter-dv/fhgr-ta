Subject: re: meter 6879 - sept. 00
This deal was not put in right. The primary term of the contract goes out to
9/30/00. There is no evergreen to the contract. The deal will end when the
Contract ends. Therefore, I have taken the evergreen off, and added
September to it.
If you have any questions, let me know.
