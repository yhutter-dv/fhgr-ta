Subject: hpl buy/sell reports
Fyi. I provided two reports to david baumbach. The reports were downloaded
To excel and saved to o:\logistics\buy _ sell _ hpl _ may _ 2000 and
Buy _ sell _ hpl _ may _ 13 _ 2000. The first report reflects buys/sells by hpl across
All pipes for the entire month of may. The second report reflects buys/sells
By hpl across all pipes for may 13, 2000, only. Both reports were derived
From the volume management module of unify. Please advise if you need
Additional information.
