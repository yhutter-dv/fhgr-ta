Ami,
Please add rhonda robinson and howard camp to the list. The items I would
Like addressed are as follows:
Vm - allocations:
1. List of meters and allocation structures - callouts, swings, etc.
2. Listing of external meter contacts
3. Copies of expense contracts
4. Overview of the transactions - this may not be accomodatable in this
Meeting, but an overview of some of the transactions, i. E. From deal to
Settlements
5. Ensure all expense contracts are set up
6. Discussion of any impact to any of the major industrial customers, i. E.
Entex, equistar, hl & p
Vm - transport
1. Imbalances
2. #of shippers, contracts, invoices
3. Any special transactions that need to be handled via the settlements
Process
4. Copies of contracts
5. Customer contact listing for each account
I realize that all of these things may not be addressed in this meeting, but
They have to be answered by someone very soon in order for vm to do our
Jobs. Hopefully, if the ces representative cannot answer the questions, he
Can direct me to someone who can and quickly. Let me know if you have any
Questions. Thanks for your role in this meeting.
