Subject: re: meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
Vance,
The issue is that the 4229 meter has been terminated in the system, per
Cheryl jones, effective 2/00. Therefore, any purchases at that point, for
02/00 forward, are ua 4 and are probably having a negative impact on your
Accrual. I think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level?
There have not been any measured volumes at 4229 since its termination, so, i
Don' t know where exactly the term calpine deal is, physically. Your
Assistance in clearing this up is greatly appreciated.
