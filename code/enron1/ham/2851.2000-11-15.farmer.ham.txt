Charlene,
We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29 - 30 th. No price was
Negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last
Price on the deal to cover those days. What price is hesco showing?

Charlene,
Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12 th and 13 th. You may
Need to have the volumes updated by volume management.
I added the 15 th and 16 th to the deal ticket.
