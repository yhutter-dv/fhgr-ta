Subject: teco' s indian spring plant
A meeting was held on november 1, 2000 at 3 pm in eb 3270 to resolve exxon' s
Residue volume issue at teco' s indian spring plant. Exxon' s issue is that
The residue volumes that hpl is recording for exxon' s account for
Transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to
Pge.
Items that were identified so that exxon' s issue could be resolved:
1. Hpl is responsible for any ua 4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on pge' s line
Attributable to exxon' s big sandy production.
2. If exxon' s production exceeds 500 mcf/d, hpl must on a monthly basis
Elect to process or not process the exxon big sandy gas. If hpl elects
To process, then teco buys the products from hpl.
3. If exxon' s production flows between 100 mcf/d and 499 mcf/d, then teco
Can process and makeup the shrinkage to hpl with their own gas volumes.
4. If exxon' s production is less than 100 mcf/d, then hpl must terminate
The processing agreement. If hpl does not terminate and volume continue
To flow at less that 100 mcf/d than hpl loses the shrinkage and must
Pay to teco an additional $500 per month.
Solution:
1. Hpl will schedule and record the gain/loss volumes at hpl meter #986884
That is attributable to ua 4 and fuel on the pge line.
2. Hpl will schedule and record the sale volumes of pvr to teco at hpl
Meter #986884.
3. The scheduling of the volumes for items 1 and 2 will allow for offset
Volumes to be record as adjustments to exxon' s transport volumes.
4. The hpl logistics dept. (mary poorman) will inform assets group (jack
Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for exxon fall below 100 mcf/d.
If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please
Let me know at x - 36650.
Thanks, clem
