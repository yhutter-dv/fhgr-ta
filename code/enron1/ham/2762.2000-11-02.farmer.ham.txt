The lakecreek lateral is baseload for the expected load, the set point may
Change up and down in anticipation of weather changes but pressure supply for
Entex is provided via the copano 12", entex shouldcommunicate with us
Directly.

That is not what I am conveying. There may be changes made to the set flow
Periodically, but it will not be pressure based upon the immediate needs of
The copano pipeline that may be swinging due to some other customer on their
System. Whenever entex asks for a new set point at the new woodlands city
Gate, our set point at the new bammel interconnect should align with that
Same set point so as there is no swing service on the copano pipeline. Our
Instructions should only come from entex to change the set point, and should
Be confirmed with copano. We are not to provide any instantaneous swing
Service on the copano lake creek lateral. Any swing provided by hpl for the
Woodland' s load will be made into the copano 12" (formerly ksc) line as
Historically done. There may be additional capacity needed on the lake creek
Lateral because of the revised set point, but that is something that entex
Has negotiated with copano independent of hpl. Still fuzzy?

Steve,
Baseload means rateable flows throughout the 24 hour gas day? No swing with
Weather?
