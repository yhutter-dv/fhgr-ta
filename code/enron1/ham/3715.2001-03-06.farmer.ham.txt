Daren,
We are working with mark mccoy on getting some things repathed in the
System. It appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in unify
Just the deliveries - not sure why????. We have been paying the suppliers
Based on whatever they invoice us for, which typically has been a smaller
Number than what we have in unify. Also, we have not been able to get a
Contact for the allocation statement. In some cases, we get the summary
Sheet, but no detail and some months we don' t get anything at all. Do you
Know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on
A timely and consistent basis? The contacts on the allocation statements
That we do have are not returning phone calls. I also need to know what was
The beginning balance when we took this on for tenaska? Anything else that
We need from you, I will call you.
Thanks,
Rw
