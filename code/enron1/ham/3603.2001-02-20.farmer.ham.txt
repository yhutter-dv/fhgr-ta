Subject: feb 12 th sale to aquila
Fyi
Daren - - - on the 12 th, there is a sale to aquila on the header system, for
10, 000........ I think we were supplying it with aec. For whatever reason, i
Had the aec 10. 0@ #11230 into midcon... Which isnt right because there was no
Market for it, and midcon wasnt looking for it, but the aquila deal was at
#700 on wgr (aquila). So I went ahead and changed the aec ticket to match up
With the aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.
Thanks,
Mark
