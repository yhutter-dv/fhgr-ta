Aimee:
The crow o' connor, meter 6757 has its gas allocated to strangers gas for
April and may 1999 and duke has been calling settlements asking for their
Money. I will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter for
These months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and
Valid deal #for this transaction.
In addition, the sarco lateral, meter 5192 has its gas allocated to strangers
Gas for may and july 1999 and duke has been calling settlements asking for
Their money. I will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter
For these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and
Valid deal #for this transaction.
I would like to get this done asap since the customer is calling settlements
And we start close next week.
Thanks,
Fred
