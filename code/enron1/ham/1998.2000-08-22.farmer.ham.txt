Subject: ect - im waha???
Should these not be converted to ena - im texas??? Some time ago - we were
Told this desk was dead and the existing deals would end. This desk is not
Included in any texas desk portfolios.
The ect desks are supposed to be inactive - however - these deals keep
Rolling - and
Someone created some new ones? If the desk is active - should we change it
To ena - im waha -
As ect is no more???
