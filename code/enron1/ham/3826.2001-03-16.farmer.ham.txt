I have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term, firm deal. This resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the global contracts system. The term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal (4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month.
To the best of my knowledge, all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen. They expire at the end of the primary term.
So, unless exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a" 10 day notification" to terminate, there isn' t any reason to" terminate" this contract.
If this is the case, please advise. Otherwise, I don' t think we need to do anything. The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.

Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow march 16, 2001 on the above referenced deal. Houston pipe line company has not renegotiated a price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis. It is my understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the delivery period
