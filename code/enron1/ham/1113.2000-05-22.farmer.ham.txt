Subject: june availabilities
Ami,
Attached is the list of june availabilities for enron to sell. I have listed
The pipeline beside the offshore volumes and am in the process of doing the
Same for the onshore. We are still waiting on a couple of volumes on some of
The outside operated properties and have estimated availabilities for those
Properties. Additionally, the pvr factors are estimated and will also be
Provided as they become available.
Please feel free to call me with any questions you have.
Thanks,
Steve
