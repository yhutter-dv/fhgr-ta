Subject: upcoming sitara risk assignment release
In order to prepare for the upcoming sitara release to production scheduled
On 01/24, sitara will be unavailable as follows:
Production 01/21 (fri.) 7: 00 pm (cst) thru 01/23 (sun.) 12: 00 pm (cst)
Conversion and checkout of data for risk assignment release
(sitara and cpr)
Parallel 01/14 (fri.) 7: 00 pm (cst) thru 02/01 (tue.) 8: 00 am (cst) parallel
Environment will be used as hot back - up, view access only
(sitara)
I wanted to make sure everyone had plenty of advance notice. I would like
Each of you to review these times with your staff. The production release is
The largest to date and the time required to convert the data cannot be
Shortened any more. Production users will not be impacted by the lack of the
Parallel environment - we will continue to bridge deal updates to unify
Parallel as we do now for the period stated above; however access to sitara
Parallel will be kept to view only. A list of items included in this release
Will be forthcoming, as well as training for groups impacted by the risk
Assignment change.
I appreciate your help in making this happen. Any questions, please do not
Hesitate to call myself or the sitara hotline (x 37049)
