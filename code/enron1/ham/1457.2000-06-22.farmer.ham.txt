Subject: vacation
Bh,
I plan to be on vacation july 5 - 6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the
7 th. While I am out, gary hanks will be keeping our position during
Trading. Stacey will be in charge of everything else. I am comfortable that
Everything will be covered.
I will be back in town thursday night. The primary flight for the customer
Trip leaves around 11: 30. Others leave at 3: 30 and 5: 30 (?). The latest
Idea we had is that pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will
Take a later flight on the august trip, allowing one of us to be in the
Office for half the day. I can also come in for the half day on the 7 th if
We decide that is needed.
