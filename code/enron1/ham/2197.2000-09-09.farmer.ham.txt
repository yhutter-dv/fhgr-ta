Subject: re: equistar buybacks
The only valid" buyback" ticket for meter #: 1373 is sitara ticket #:
246408. S. Ticket #: 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up
Buyback
Ticket across equistar' s meters {1552, 1384, 1062, 1553}. If you recall
This process was done to enable client services to automate equistar
Allocation/billing. The project took place around april 2000
Production retroactive back to jan. 1999. The link to compute the buyback is
Set up
On s. Ticket #246408.
Since equistar has begun doing business via ena, it was necessary to
Establish a" buyback ticket" on ena' s matrix.
Thus, to answer your question, yes there should only be one" buyback
Ticket" for meter #: 1373 on hpl and ena.
Ena activity is kept whole and the swing is on hpl.
I hope I have addressed all of your questions below however, I am
Available for follow up discussion if needed.
It has been a pleasure working with you. I learned a lot about the
Business while scheduling industrials and thanks for the opportunity.

Subject: equistar buybacks
Robert,
There are three buy back tickets in sitara for equistar at mtr 1373. Two for
Hpl and one under ena. Shouldn' t we have only one buyback for each company?
Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ena contract
And hpl contract?
