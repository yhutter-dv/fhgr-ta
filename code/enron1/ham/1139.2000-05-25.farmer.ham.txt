Subject: june transport usage tickets
The tickets are finished. I have updated most of the third party tickets,
With the exception of oasis/west of prairie lea and oasis/east of prairie
Lea. I saw several may tickets with this path, and want to conserve
Tickets. I set up one ticket for this path. Please let me know if you have
Any questions. Dave, once volumes get attached to these tickets, I would
Like to run a basis adjustment report by pipe to double - check the desk
Rates. Thanks.

Subject: june transport usage tickets
I updated the june transport usage tickets today through hpl, and will be
Finishing these tickets tomorrow. Rates have been updated to reflect current
Matrix rates and all baseload rates that I know of at this time. I have not
Yet received third party transport rates, so if you know of any, please let
Me know. Also, I have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for june, so
Your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them. Rule of thumb
Was that if I had to add a month, I refreshed the rate but left volume at
Zero. If the months were already on the ticket, then I refreshed the rate
And left the volume as is.
I would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure
They' re reflected in position manager correctly. Please let me know if you
Have any questions. All pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning.
