Subject: meter 6315
Daren,
I have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal. Flow was for
The first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process
Of being shut in. We purchased the gas from torch - rally partnership in
Sept. Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers?
Please advise.
Mary
