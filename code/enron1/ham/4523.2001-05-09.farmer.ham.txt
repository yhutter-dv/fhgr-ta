Tess,
I have changed sitara to agree with the contract. This was changed during flash to get around some pricing errors.

Please advise on the 04/01 price for sales deal #sa 413462 on this buyback (swing deal). The contract shows the price for 04/01 should be the same price as shown for 03/01 & 05/01 (i. E. 04/01 price for deal #sa 413462 should be: 10, 000@ hsc _ flw + 1 high gdp d. A. & 11, 000@ hsc _ flw + 2 high gdp da).
