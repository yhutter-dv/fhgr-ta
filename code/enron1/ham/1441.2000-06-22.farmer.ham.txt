Subject: customer trip
The july customer trip is right around the corner. I' m sure you will be
Hearing more questions from your customers as the day arrives. Just in case,
Here are a few helpful hints.
I am currently (today) in the process of putting together a to bring list for
You customers. Just a helpful list of clothing items, sun skin care
Suggestions, etc. List that they may want to pack. An agenda will be coming
Shortly after that. As you all know each of your customers are responsible
For getting themselves to florida. If for some reason you have a.....
. High maintenance customer who is really pushing the issue of us helping
Them find a flight we will help target some flights they can take. They will
Still be responsible for the fare. Please don' t freely offer this
Suggestion only use it as an emergency.
I do have the list of each of your customers who have rsvp' d. If you have any
Customers who you are afraid may back out please let me know who they are so
That I can make a" glad you' re coming do you have any questions?" phone call
A few days before departure to ensure they are still coming.
If you have any other questions or concerns, let me know.
