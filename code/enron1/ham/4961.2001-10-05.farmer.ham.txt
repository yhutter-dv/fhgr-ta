Subject: important information about security & clickathome
Dear clickathome participant,
Clickathome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you. As part of the clickathome program, you may download and update norton antI - virus and blackice defender software from the clickathome portal.
Norton antivirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically. It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.
Blackice defender is an industrial - strength antI - hacker system that protects your pc by scanning your dsl, cable modem, or dial - up internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system.
By installing and updating both norton antivirus and blackice defender, your clickathome pc will have the latest security offered by these two products.
Instructions for accessing the portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@ enron. Com. Thank you for your participation in clickathome.
The clickathome team!
