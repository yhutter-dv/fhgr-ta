This is a follow up to the e - mail I sent earlier in th month.
Please be advised that we have discrepancies with the state and county information for the meter no. (s) listed on the attached spreadsheet.
Will you please review this spreadsheet and provide the state and county information that you may have for the listed meters.
If you are not the scheduler for this pipe please forward this to the appropriate scheduler.
Please do not hesitate to contact me.
Thank you,
