Subject: entex delivery off of oasis
Just a quick reminder that we need to cover the entex delivery off of oasis.
Currently ena has a transport agreement on oasis. This agreement will not be assigned.
Not use aep has an agreement on oasis. Just to make sure, I would recommend we
Sale the gas to aep/hpl at the point for the month of june just to make sure the delivery
Is made.
Let me know what you think.
Thanks
