Subject: panenergy 4/01
Daren:
Did we exchange with panenergy in april? If we did, can you send me your nom sheet? Meter 7052 - castle busby looks different this month. Elsa did some deals with highland energy at 7052. We normally buy all of the gas from duke at this meter when we exchange. There also wasn' t flow every day, so duke' s volume is very small.
Thanks,
Megan
