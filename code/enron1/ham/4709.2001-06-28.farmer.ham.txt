Start your own free email list at http:// www. Listbot. Com/links/joinlb
Folks,
You' ve probably already read that listbot is dying as of august 6.
So, i' ve created a transition list on another service. To send messages to
The list, please start using the following e - mail address:
Brcc. Yf@ topica. Com
I plan on closing the old list (@ listbot. Com) as of
Friday, august 13.
If you are still interested in participating in the" bammel young families"
List, please send an e - mail to" brcc. Yf - subscribe@ topica. Com".
If you think you' ll want to check the past messages, or to create your own
Lists in the future, use the following steps:
1. Go to http:// www. Topica. Com/lists/brcc. Yf
2. On the right hand side of the page, type in your e - mail address under
" not a topica member yet"
3. Click" continue"
4. Fill in the registration, then click the" I agree" button
5. You' ll next see a page with text like" thanks, ram! You' re almost done."
6. Scroll to the end of this page, and click the" continue" button.
7. A dialog will pop - up, asking whether you want to" tap into exclusive...
Blah, blah, blah". Just click cancel.
Once you join the new list, please drop me an e - mail to
" rtackett@ abacustech. Net". I' ll then delete you from the old so that you
Won' t get duplicate messages from both lists.
The messages on the new list will be available to members online at:
Http:// www. Topica. Com/lists/brcc. Yf
One nice feature of topica is the ability to put messages on" vacation
Hold", so that we don' t end up with auto - responder problems. For more info
On" vacation hold", go to http:// topica. Com/#and then click on the
" vacation hold" link under" subscriber services".
Thanks,
Ram tackett
