Thanks. James armstrong was able to give me enough history to prove out the idea that we' ve more than paid for the lateral with usage - based charges. No need to call lone star.

For the period of oct 2000 - apr 2001, we have paid about 540, 000. May is estimated to be another 57, 000. The person who usually pays lone star is out of the office. We' ll get her to call them on monday for payments prior to oct 2000.

Importance: high
Section 6. 4 of tenaska iv' s gas transportation agreement with lone star requires the shipper to pay transporter $1, 040, 000 in transportation fees and/or deficienty payments from the initial delivery date through december 31, 2003. Do we know what the payments to lone star have been to date? If not, can we find out by contacting lone star?
