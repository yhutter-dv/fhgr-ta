Equistar will be bringing the syngas plant back up effective may 10. While the plant has been down, enron has been buying the gas back at hsc - $. 02. Their load will come back up on the 10 th and the price will be the fixed price on the deal of $5. 75.
I appreciate your help on this. Please let me know if there are any questions.
