Subject: cornhusker imbalance
Daren - - the cleburne plant is consistantly pulling more than we are supplying.. Approx. 3. 0 to 5. 0 day - - - - - - new current imbalance of (95. 0) due lonestar (based on lonestar estimates). Are you interested in payback? Maybe 10. 0 a day? Let me know and I will clear it with lonestar.
Thanks,
Mark
