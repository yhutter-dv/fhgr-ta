Subject: meter 980070; oct 99
Daren,
There are two purchases at the above referenced meter for the 28 th of oct.,
1999. Gas flowed without a purchase from the 29 th through the 31 st. Please
Let me know if we should be paying the swing parties (deal ticketsl 17738 and
120359), or how I should allocate the volume.
Thank you for your time and patience!!
