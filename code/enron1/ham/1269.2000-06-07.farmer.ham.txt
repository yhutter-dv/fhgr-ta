Subject: eis invoices for may
I just wanted to make all of you aware of the message below from financial
Operations. When you review your rc reports for may, you will not see any it
Charges. There were also none recorded in april. Therefore, be prepared to
See some large charges in june for 3 months (april - june). If you have any
Questions, please call me. Thanks.
