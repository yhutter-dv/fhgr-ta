Deal #421859 sales
Deal #421847 purchase
Settlements is showing both a sales and purchase for texas general land
Office and they are stating that they should not be billed or paid for
Anything.
Are these deals suppose to be a washout and netted together?
If so, the volumes are not matching: the sales on hpl are 7, 440 mmbtus on
Deal #421859 and the purchase on midtx is 6, 629 mmbtus.
Let me know what type of deal this was intended to be.
Fyi
I was told that tom acton was handling this deal, but I believe he will be
Out until after thanksgiving.
