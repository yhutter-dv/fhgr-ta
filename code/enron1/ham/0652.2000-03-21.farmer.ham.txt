Subject: tejas deliveries at oasis katy
On tuesday, march 7 th, tejas took gas from us at oasis katy and gave it back
To us at tejas laporte to help us out during an outage for $. 02/mmbtu. This
Transaction has not been scheduled correctly. There are two deal tickets in
Sitara to cover the oasis portion of the deal: #213145 covers ena selling
The gas to hplc for hplc to transport on tejas. Deal #213370 covers the
Transport usage on tejas from oasis katy to laporte. I have edited this
Ticket to add the $. 02/mm charge. There needs to be a tejas expense contract
At laporte, #665, to cover the approx. 25, 000 mm received there on the 7 th.
These volumes are currently sitting on the laporte oba.
Jackie - if you would work with carlos he should be able to walk you through
Getting this scheduled correctly in all systems.
Thanks.
