Okay, this one has been resolved.... The deals for days 9 and 10 are good.
Sitara did not feed this deal to mops at all therefore it didn' t feed to
Pops.
Sherlyn is setting things up and will provide me with a tracking id, I will
Enter volumes and re - allocate the meter.
Very confusing but finally resolved.

Charlotte,
There is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2/99. It appears the
Variance is created on 2/9/99 and 2/10/99. There is a transport usage deal
Ticket 72893 in sitara which shows pg & e delivers 6, 965 mmbtu to hpl on 2/9/99
And 3, 683 mmbtu on 2/10/99, but hpl does not show a receipt of this volume.
Let me know if you need the pg & e support.
