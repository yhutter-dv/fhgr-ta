Karie: deal number 60747 should be the good deal. Deal number 60747 is an
Interruptible storage deal and contract 96016959 is an interruptible
Contract. Storage deal 47472 is a firm storage deal. Since it doesn' t agree
With the firmness of the contract, I would probably cut off that deal going
Forward. - tommy

There are two storage deals that are using the same contract number. Julie
Meyers believes that deal 47472 is the correct deal, but wants to check with
You first since you put in deal 60747. Let me know when you look at them if
We need to cut off or kill deal 60747.
