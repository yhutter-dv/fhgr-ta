Subject: life in general
Good god - - - - where do you find time for all of that. You should write a book when the kids go off to college. By then you should have many many stories.
By the way what is your new address? I may want to come by some evening with a lawn chair and a 6 pack. Watching you work sounds better than anything on tv.
You will make a good trader. Good relationships and flexible pricing are all you need. Oh, and a few zillion other intangibles you will run into. It beats the hell out of most other things though.
I' ll let you be for now, but do keep those stories coming - - - - we love them.
