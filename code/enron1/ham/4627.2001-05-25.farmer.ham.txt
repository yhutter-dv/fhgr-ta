Subject: lufkin
On may 27 th a lufkin industrial market will go down by 5, 000. We are going to move this sale to lyondell meter #5045. The sales price will remain at index minus $. 12. The sale will remain at lyondell for approximately 2 weeks. Since the screen has fallen about $1 this should be a good thing for us and a very nice thing for entex to do for us.
Thanks,
Janet
