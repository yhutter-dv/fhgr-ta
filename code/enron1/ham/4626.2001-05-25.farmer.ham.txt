Subject: tenaska iv 4/01
We need to change the demand fee on deal 384258 for tenaska iv for 4/01. The williams invoice was not as much as the spreadsheet showed, so our expenses decreased. Please change the amount from $2, 979, 909. 91 to $2, 862, 531. 95. I have attached the revised spreadsheet.
Thanks,
Megan
