Prior to 7/99 this was ena not hpl, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99. The deal ticket we used was 62717. I will have to look further into the ena activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

This ticket starts with 7/99 production. How were all of the other months paid?

Daren,
I am trying to get some payments out to williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have black marlin pipeline company inc. Instead of black marlin pipeline company effective 3/99. The black marlin pipeline company was for an internal record (when it was an enron entity).
