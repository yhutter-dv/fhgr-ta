Subject: sitara training
I will be giving a training session on wed 9/13/00 in 21 c 2 from 3: 00 - 4: 30
Pm.
I would like for you to send to the class any new logistics personnel that
You might think could use a sitara overview.
If someone cannot make it at this time, let me know their names and I will
Try to schedule something for them at a later time.
If possible, please send me a note on who might be attending, so I can get an
Approximate head count.
