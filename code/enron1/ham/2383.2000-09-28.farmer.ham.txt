Mary:
Is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow? The large variance
Between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled
For dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy #2 wells. It
Appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where
985, 350 mmbtu was confirmed. This well has never flowed this much volume,
And in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320, 000 mmbtu. Do we actually have
Support (i. E we talked with someone or have a nom sheet) for the 985, 350
Mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed? This trend of" nothing" being
Confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000. In august 2000
This scenario changed and 612, 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was
Scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy #2 wells.
From reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at
These wells that we expected. If the issue is an actual increase in the
Volumes flowing at these wells, I would suggest that you call our gas
Measurement department and ask them to audit coral' s charts. Coral may be is
Calculating the volumes incorrectly.
This could also be an allocations issue. The allocation as it is in the
System today closely agrees with the allocation statement that I receive
Monthly from karen lambert at tejas. The only differences between the tejas
Schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which
Are not scheduled and therefore not allocated. I know that you are working
On the acock production and tom acton and I are working on the gain/loss.
Tom will tell me how to path the gas so that I can set up accounting
Arrangements for april 1999 forward. Scheduling will have analyze and
Possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were
Originally set up in pops.
I want to help, so if I have missed the issue (s) would you please clarify it
Or them for me and let me know if I need to do anything for you.
Thanks,
Fred

Daren & tom,
Beginning with august production, I noticed that big cowboy, into king ranch
Appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination/day. Per a
Conversation I had with fred boas today, I discovered that two wells with
Zero noms flowed a considerable volume.
They are as follows:
Rocher big cowboy (27002) - 42, 000 approx.
Big cowboy #2 (27003 - 84, 000 approx.
Total flow: 126, 000 mm' s, more or less
I think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
To account for, in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
Came on in august. Please let me know what you think. I would like to make
Sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and
Our economics.
Thank you,
Mary
