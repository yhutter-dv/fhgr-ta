Subject: re: meter 0980438 - acock production??????
I have spoken with clem, this meter is now" non - allocatable", not unlike
Meter 8751 on big cowboy. This meter needs to be set up as a receipt meter
Attached to the gulf energy 27 - 009 - 08 agreement. This gas began flowing on
7/7/00, so deal ticket 380710, which begins 9/1/00 will need to be backed up
To july to account for the purchase of this production.
Bob: please email me when the deal ticket is complete so that I can have
Fred set up accounting arrangements on gulf energy.
Fred: can you please determine whether or not we have paid ccgm for this gas?
Once again, thank you all for your assistance.
