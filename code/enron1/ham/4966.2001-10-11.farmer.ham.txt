Subject: bosses day
Hey kids, why don' t we pool our resources and get" el jefe" something nice? Not like last year... I won' t mention names (donna).... When some individuals within the team didn' t want to include the rest of us in their" reindeer games" for bosses day. Any suggestions? Round of golf, gift certificate??? I nominate suzanne to collect the money. Any objections?
Thanks
