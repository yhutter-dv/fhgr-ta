Subject: escalation procedures - gas logistics
Desk managers,
I will be issuing a small laminated version of the attached list of contacts for escalation of unify and edI issues in a small laminated version. The objective in putting richard first on the list is to address any issues that are business related or education related prior to getting it folks involved; thereby, freeing up our it folks to work on programming fixes and enhancements.

After implementation, if you feel these escalation procedures are not providing the level of support your desk requires, please let me know.
Regards,
Tammy
