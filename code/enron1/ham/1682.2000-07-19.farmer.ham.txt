Rob,
I got your name from doug leach. He thought that you would be the person to
Talk to about this.
I got a call last night from rudolph maldonado. (the operator forwarded him
Our way.) he stated that he has some natural gas to sell in saudI arabia.
His number is 562 - 866 - 1755. Could you give him a call and check this out? I
Told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.
I can be reached at 3 - 6905 if you have any questions.
