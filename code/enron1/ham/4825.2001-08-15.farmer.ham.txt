It looks like we have a consensus on down time for unify gas production on saturday. We will be bringing the server down at 6 pm. Please make every effort to have your work done by that time. The server should be back up by 10 pm.
Thank you all for your responses and cooperation,

Importance: high
We will be performing maintenance on the server for the unify database on saturday, aug. 18 th. This maintnenance will fix the problem that caused unify' s gas production database to hang indefinitely today (tue., aug. 14 th) during our nomination time.
Please reply and tell us when we can shut down the unify gas production system for this maintenance on saturday, aug. 18 th. We are targeting 4 pm.
