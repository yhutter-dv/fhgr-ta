HI again,
?
I can hardly wait for some good stuff regarding my" friend". I do hope you
Understand I am not against the person or persons - - just the way they do
Their jobs.
?
I can' t believe pat just left. Must have been a really bad meeting. Who took
His place?
?
I see henry hub was close to $7. 50 yesterday. Amazing. Your producers must
Be happy.
?
Trees - - ha. It is getting to be a choice between trees or gifts.
?
Markets up nicely, courts ruling nicely, greenspan softening his stance on
Interest, linda not shopping as much as prior years. Looking good today.
?
Later,
Ken
