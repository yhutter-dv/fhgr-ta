Daren - did we have a purchase from beaumont methonal on 2/9? I show a deal of 5. 000 on deal 611178. I confirmed a total of 13. 000 (deal 603107) for that day. Were we buying back 5. 000 or was the deal reduced to 13000?

Ok thanks! Will be there shortly. Also, joanie received a call from beaumont stating that there is a sale to hpl on 2/9 for 5, 000 mmbtu. This was reflected on the supply draft and buddy majorrwitz looked into this before he/we released invoice and said that there were no sales to hpl from beaumont. Do you have any support or documentation re: any/all 02/01 prod. Sales to hpl? If so, can I also get a copy of that support to fax to customer?

I still handle meter 1428. I checked my notes for 2/13. There was an intraday change from 18. 000 to 0. When it was changed to 0, the meter had already flowed 3. 811. It is a valid volume. If you have anymore questions, please let me know.

Aimee -
Per conversation with rosa brown and thu (in volumes management, beaumont methanol is a swing deal, by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr. Thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter #981428.
Do you still handle the sales allocations for hpl meter #981428? If so, can you confirm 02 - 01 sales (on hpl, meter #981428., sales deal #603107), to beaumont methanol (which we' ve invoiced them), vs. Chyral hankins' e - mial to buddy majorwitz below? The only date that is really in question is sales for flow date 02 - 13 - 01 (she reflects noms of 0 vs. The 3, 811 mmbtu that we invoiced them).
Thanks,
Tess ray
