Subject: september deal inactivation in sitara
Currently, prior month deals are inactivated in sitara for portfolio
Purposes on the 10 th of the month.
For system efficiencies we would like to inactivate september deals this
Weekend if possible. This will have no affect on volume feedback.
A system enhancement is being worked on so that we would not have to try to
Inactivate earlier than normal for next month.
Please contact me if this timing would cause you any problems.
Thank you
Russ
