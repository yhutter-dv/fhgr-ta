Daren,
Just a quick note to follow up on ua 4 issues.
For desk to desk deals, we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not
A co 16 contract with co 16 and attaching an ect transport contract to the
Backscreen.
On park and ride deals, I am under the impression that the park and ride deal
Would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a
Subsequent month.
If this is true, was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co
89 entry. I am not sure whether an ect transport should be attached. I hope
You have some insight on this issue.
Let me know
Hc
