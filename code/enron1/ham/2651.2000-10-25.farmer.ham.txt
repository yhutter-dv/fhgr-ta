Subject: proposed solution
Pat,
I have been working with volume management, settlements, vance, and bob to
Clean up some prior period and prior - to - current month issues. This process
Should result in a correction to booked profit/loss for vance and the desk.
This has brought to my attention that we have been paying some parties
Manually for volumes when deals are not correctly entered. I would propose
That logistics be included in the communication of when checks are manually
Cut. It would be especially beneficial if we tracked manual checks by
Counterparty, meter, and/or deal ticket id or price. I feel that this will
Allow us to spot and resolve potential issues more effectively.
Please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter.
Thank you for your time,
Mary
