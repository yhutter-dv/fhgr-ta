I just have to brag on myself as my game seldom affords me the opportunity.
Sunday after church, tom knox and I played 18 holes at mimosa. The weather
Was perfect. While my game stunk overall (118), I did manage par on one par
3 and two par 5' s. The best was at 14 - - - a 545 yard par 5. My drive was
280 yards (the ground was flat!). I was on the green three feet from the
Pin in 3, and then two - putted. Those three pars however will keep me going
Back. Remember, I had a witness!
Thanks for listening to me brag. And no, don' t expect me to replicate these
Feats on our next outing. Hope all are doing well. We' re remembering
Rachel and jake in our prayers each day.
