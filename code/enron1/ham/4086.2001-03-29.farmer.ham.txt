We need to forward the money from the feb 2001 brazos sale to tenaska iv. I
Am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand
Fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1, 143, 484. 53. There is already a demand
Fee for feb 2001 for $29, 851. 64, so I think we just need to change that to
The new amount. Let me know if you want to handle this differently.
