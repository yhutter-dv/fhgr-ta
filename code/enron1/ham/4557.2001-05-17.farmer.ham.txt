Is" not going to aep" considered an accomplishment? By the way, most of the people who could give performance feedback on me are leaving or have left the company. I' m sure they thought that I was superior though.

It' s that time again.
Please put together a list of accomplishments for the first six months.
I know you can use the system some how, just not sure how.
Let me know.
Thanks
