Jay,
Let' s not assume what impact this will have. Even though it is better to zero out deals we (vm) wouldn' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals.
We do have a few questions.
I would like to discuss what minimal impact is? How do you know what impact this will have? Is there a reason this will have little impact? Do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them?
Who decided to do this?
Why are we doing this?
What time span are we talking (production months/year)
Let' s determine the impact if any?
I would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact?
Thanks,
M. M.

Jay,
If a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in unify if there are any paths associated with the deal; therefore, we request the deals be zeroed out. Call me if this is a problem. Also, we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed.
In addition, I have copied rita and mark from volume management for their input.
Regards,
Tammy

You may want to let the schedulers know, although they may already.

Richars/tammy:
We will be killing about 2000 deals in sitara tonight. Whenever a deal is touched in sitara, it will bridge over to unify. These are desk 2 desk deals, and should have minimal impact on you.
