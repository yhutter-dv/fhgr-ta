Dave,
Guess I had some misinformation on the type. Per yvette, the platelets or cells in darren farmer' s blood were the match and the blood type was secondary. I' m not sure how it works, but darren is definitely the guy. I have a call in to lisa to clarify this.
Kris

Funny... When I talked to daren, he said he was a +. Could it be daron giron?

HI dave,
Thanks for offering to talk to darren about lisa & christopher. Lisa can be reached at home at 281 - 296 - 0788 or cell 713 - 443 - 4523. I' m sure she can fill in the details on how to have the blood credited to her account.
Anyone else you know of who has b - blood and would like to give would be much appreciated!
Kris
