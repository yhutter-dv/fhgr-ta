Subject: not as rough list
I spoke to sabrae, we are cumulatively balanced with pge, cumulative and don' t want to do anything volumetric at either meter. The nng oba is being reconciled, and they are really hesitant/reluctant to balance current month. Florida can be paid back 5 m or more, it is being reconciled, but, sabrae is okay with paying back. This just in from mark mccoy, the oasis oba is flat as of today' s gas day. That should hit the imb. Report next week.
