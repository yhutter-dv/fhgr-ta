Subject: prelminary findings on deals not bridging
I' ve attached a spreadsheet showing deals that were not bridged to unify for
November. Please don' t let this alarm you, this is how the bridge has always
Worked. If you have questions or would like to discuss, please let me know.
Every instance i' ve found looks okay because of the following:
* a transport ut ticket on the same pipe was the deal
* the deal was killed
* the deal was entered as a mistake buy and should of been a sell hence the
Inactive state in unify
* the deal was a demand based deal price with no volumes
* the deal didn' t have a point assigned to it, only a zone
Thanks
