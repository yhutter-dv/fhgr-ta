Tina,
Koch never returned my calls. Based on the contractual information, we may be
Putting ourselves in a risk area by' assigning' the deals without proper
Documentation. The documentation that was supplied did not refence any ena
Agreements, nor any specific meter numbers. If the purchase was indeed a
Meter/well sale; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired
And the effective date. Since we are apparently the supplier, the risk is not
As substaintial as if we were the purchaser. However, without documentation
We are basically relying on the relationship btw koch & duke.

Since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke, I would say
That duke should be paying us for the gas.
I had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but i
Wasn' t sure to whom. I either talked or left a message with someone in the
Settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
Trader that they should not be getting the invoices. However, I never heard
Back from anyone.
This is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
Year. The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch. I can
Change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty (or create new tickets)
Today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door. You
Will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
Contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing koch midstream services co under ena for meters
Ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas (sitara #144052) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe (sitara #144049). My
Former accounting contact at koch, michael thomas, said that koch sold these
South texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999. Michael faxed
A contract which I forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
Area. Cindy said she can' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
She can' t recognize the assignment. Cindy has left messages with koch, but
She has not been able to resolve the issue. Koch is refusing to pay for
The gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
These deals. I need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
Paying for this gas. Do you have any information regarding this issue?
Thanks,
Tina valadez
