Subject: mcmullen gas for 11/99
Jackie,
Since the inlet to 3 river plant is shut in on 10/19/99 (the last day of
Flow):
At what meter is the mcmullen gas being diverted to?
At what meter is hpl buying the residue gas? (this is the gas from teco,
Vastar, vintage, tejones, and swift)
I still see active deals at meter 3405 in path manager for teco, vastar,
Vintage, tejones, and swift
I also see gas scheduled in pops at meter 3404 and 3405.
Please advice. We need to resolve this as soon as possible so settlement
Can send out payments.
Thanks
