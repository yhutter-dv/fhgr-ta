Subject: texoma - beaumont hpl maintenance
This is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma -
Beaumont interconnect (replace some valves, I believe).
We had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have
Low gas takes. That window of opportunity will be in early to mid february.
Mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month.
Some of these units are endothermic, some are exothermic, so in some cases
Their gas load goes up when they take certain units down. But based on the
Schedule of ups and downs that i' ve been given, it looks like their gas load
Will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12, at somewhere
Around 50, 000/d. Last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20, 000/d
Through the low pressure meter, and delivering the rest through centana. Is
This still the plan??
We met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to
Do: that it would take less than a day, and that during that time, hpl would
Deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter. But that meeting
Was a long time ago, and we might need to meet again - you know how
Conservative
One thing of concern: in the past two months, we have effected some of our
Midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30, 000/d gas in kind to mobil
Beaumont. So we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our
Maintenance.
Once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we' ll handle
Gas flows while we do our work, i' d like to be the one that initially tells
Mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting. It' s going to take a lot
Of coordination because I can guarantee you that mobil' s maintenance schedule
Will change!
