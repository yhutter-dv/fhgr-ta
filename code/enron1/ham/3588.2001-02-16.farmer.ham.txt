Subject: jan. 01 sale to texas general land office
Deal #547201
Texas general land office has called and is disputing that this sale is a
Part of the month exchange deal for transport.
Do we have the name of the trader at texas general land office that did this
Deal with us?
The sale was for 01/01 - 01/31 for 99, 200 mmbtus at $9. 82.
Thanks - katherine
