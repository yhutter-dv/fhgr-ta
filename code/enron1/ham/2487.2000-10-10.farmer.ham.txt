Thanks for your spreadsheet. One thing I still need from you is what
Commercial teams your group was supporting overall? In addition, I noticed
You allocated 15 hours to the activity eso 02 - non routine trade monitoring &
Reporting. What commercial team (s) was this 15 hours spent supporting?
Thanks!
