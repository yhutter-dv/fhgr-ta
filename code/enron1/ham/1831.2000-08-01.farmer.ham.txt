Brenda wants to know why we flashed 24, 302 mmbtu' s with a value of $83, 827
And actuals came in at 12, 511 mmbtu' s with a value of $37, 662. Logistics is
Booking our fuel on 3 rd party pipes. Is there something logistics needs to
Do to better estimate this expense?

Then the question would be: where did we miss our projection? Once again, i
Think we should include rita in the reconciliation effort.
