Subject: neon discussion september 20
Like we talked about in our meeting in august, I am planning on? Getting
Material out for discussion on the friday preceding the neon meeting.? If it
Would help you to get it sooner, let me know so we can see what would help.?
Also, if you can' t open the attachment (it is written in microsoft word),
Let me know so that we can again do whatever' s necessary to get it to you.
?
Keep me in touch with how things are going for your group; successes,
Problems, etc.? I' ll be praying for your groups.
?
In him,
?
