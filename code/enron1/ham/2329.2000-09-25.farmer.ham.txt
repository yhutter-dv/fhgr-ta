Subject: cornhusker deal tickets
Daren - -
I know you' re busy with bid week, so here are a couple questions & comments
For you:
September
I need to know if a ticket has been set up for september for the market side
Of the williams & apache gas. We still only the supply is in mops. If it
Just needs points added to it, just let me know the deal ticket #.
August 31 st
This was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on
Lonestar 1023 & 1460. Currently, they do not have the supply points needed
For the williams & apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to
Imbalance... So I will get them added so this gas can be pathed.
July 31 - aug 7
These days were pathed as buy/sells from tenaska iv to tenaska marketing
Ventures.
I worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment (july &
Aug business), and had them do a manual entry for aug 31 st.
Please let me know what you think when you get a chance.
Thanks,
Mark
