Subject: from your clerk. Its been great!
I just wanted to let you all know that I really enjoyed working with you all. It has been a pleasure and a ton of fun to work for such great people. I hope to stay in contact with you and please keep hold of my email address and resume for anything you may see a need for in the future. Also if you wouldnt mind being a reference for me it would be greatly appreciated and you can email me your information.
Thanks again,
Jason
