Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss the teco frontera deal on monday, 4/9 at 1: 00 pm (stephanie - please arrange a conference room and forward information to all). The teco deal will start scheduling tuesday 4/10 for gas and power flow wednesday 4/11 (sorry for the late notice but teco wants to start asap). If you do not have a copy of the contract and would like one please stop by my desk and grab one at eb 3119 b or print out the attached file below (stephanie - please call and make sure all can attend the meeting).
I will give a summary of the deal and discuss with you what our obligations are. Please read the contract as this meeting will not be a substitute for a thorough reading!
