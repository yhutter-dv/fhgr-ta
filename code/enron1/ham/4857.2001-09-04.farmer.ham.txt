Subject: coral on exxonkaty 6/01
Darren:
Ena was invoiced by coral energy for two deals on tejas for june 2001 that I do not see in the system. The first deal was on 6/1 for 5, 400 at $3. 87. The second deal was on 6/13 for 22, 000 at $4. 25. Do you know anything about these deals? I think we would show it on exxonkaty, but I can' t find anything in path manager on exxonkaty or tejas.
