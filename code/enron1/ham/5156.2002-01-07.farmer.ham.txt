Tammy, richard - I would richard to take ownership of the training that would be required for the new scheduling people that will be on each desk. You can coordinate who needs training with the managers. This needs to happen asap. Also if you can line up some basic sitara training for those that need it that would be helpful. Not sure who can do the sitara piece but you can run the traps on that. I will include this effort in the plan that will be forwarded to louise today.
Let me know if you get some dates together, tks - bob
