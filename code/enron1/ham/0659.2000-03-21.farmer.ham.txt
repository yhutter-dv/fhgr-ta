Yes, they are taken care of. But in the future we need to devise some sort of
Communication from lisa kinsey so if there
Is a change with cilco, it is communicated to either you or me or aimee or
Kenny or someone and it is reflected on our
Withdrawal report.

The cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco. Please
Review the attached the spreadsheets from lisa kinsey, the central desk
Scheduler responsible for the cilco account. The biggest variance is in
January 2000. Cilco withdrew 200, 000 mmbtu' s more than we booked@ bammel.
Please let me know the best way to correct the problem. I suspect the
Variance is showing up as a transport imbalance. Also, the nomination for
The current month is 7, 327 mmbtu instead of 7, 000 mmbtu per day. 7, 000 is
The volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel.
