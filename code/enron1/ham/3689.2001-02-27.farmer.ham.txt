Subject: ces imbalances
Daren,
Can you please verify for me whether we took over any old imbalances that ces
Had? The reason I am asking if we got a letter from kinder morgan asking us
To verify an imbalance. It looks like it would of been an imbalance between
Ces and kinder morgan. We don' t show anything in our system and want to
Verify that we shouldn' t.
Thanks and if I need to provide any further information, please let me know.
Karen
