98 - 1534 is on the 215 k for 3/2000 but is only good for 3/1 - 3/1 in sitara,
On deal #163005. Can you see if it is o. K. To extend the deal for the rest
Of the month? It has flow every day after the lst.
98 - 6725 is also on the 215 k for 3/2000. The sitara deal #is 214948 and
Covers every day except for day 16. Can you also see if it is o. K. To extend
