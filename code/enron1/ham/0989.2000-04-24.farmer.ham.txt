Subject: popsprd migration
The popsprd bridge will be migrated to nahou - scacll on april 26 th for
Debugging purposes. This migration should be transparent for pops users with
The exception of personal spread sheets using pops tags. The node name for
Pops tags on personal spread sheets will need to be changed to nahou - scacll
To allow for updating of pops data.
Please call me if you have any questions concerning the migration.
