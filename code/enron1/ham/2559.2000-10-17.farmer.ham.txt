Mark,
I understand that you need a note for your files regarding the tenaska plant.
On saturday, october 14, 2000 at 5: 14 am, the plant had a catastrophic
Failure of the gas turbine. The entire plant is essentially shutdown until
These repairs can be made. This outage will last a minimum of 10 days. Ken
Riesz will keep you informed of our progress.
I hope this is what you need. Let me know.
