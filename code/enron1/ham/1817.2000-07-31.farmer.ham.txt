Subject: cleburne outage
Gentlemen,
I wanted to clarify the length of the outage that started today at the
Cleburne site.
The earliest the plant will be on - line is wednesday morning. If anything is
Found beyond a cracked transition piece or clogged fuel nozzle then it may
Extend the outage a few days. As soon as I hear something I will let you know.
Michael
