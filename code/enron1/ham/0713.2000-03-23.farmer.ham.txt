Yes. I have confirmed that fw rabalais is agent for dallas (aka sam allen),
Which was put under lila allen' s name. Please change deal 144932 from sam
Allen to dallas exploration.

I looked in global and dallas exploration is in there. Can we put the deal
Under dallas exploration? That is where is it was set up at columbia. I
Have a letter and the gisb contract from sam allen that we are to pay dallas
Exploration.
