Subject: february 2000 production, pg & e discrepancy for 02/24/00 (pan
Energy exchange deal)
Stacey -
As per my earlier voice mail messages, I needed to confirm what the actual
Flow of gas was on pg & e for february 24 th. The service summary report from
Pg & e indicated a flow of 50, 000 mmbtus on the 24 th, however, the swamp rat
Fuel allocations (hpl) indicates a flow of 53, 000 mmbtus. Can you ask pg & e
To confirm which of these volume is correct so that the february allocations
Can be finalized? Please let me know if there is any additional information
I need to provide you.
Thanks for your help -
