Robert,
I' ve taken care of 98 - 6719 (as far as getting it out of my allocation
Exception screen). I' m going to place 98 - 9676 on strangers gas until you
Hear back from daren or julie.
Should daren or julie get back w/you, while i' m on vacation, please get back
W/anita luong and provide her with the k #given to you (by daren or julie)
As well as the dates of 2/1 - 2/29 (even though 3/1/2000 is reflected in my
Allocation exception screen) so that she can provide you with an accounting
Arrangement to place february' s volumes on@ this meter.
It looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3/1/2000. I guess that the
Trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter.
Thanks

All wellhead deals through tom acton first.
