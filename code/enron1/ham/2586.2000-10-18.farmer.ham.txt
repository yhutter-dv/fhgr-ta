Paul, please pass this on to anyone who would need to know. Beginning
September 00 and continuing for one year, ena is buying production tied
Directly
Into entex' s pipeline system. The company we are purchasing from is osborne
Oil and we are selling directly to entex under the big contract at if plus
+. 769.
This meter will be allocated by a third party and the meter statement will be
Sent to us and entex. We will bill & pay off of the meter statement (if this
Is not possible or reasonable, let me know). See attached pricing for
Osborne.
I would like the person whom is paying osbourne to contact me.
Thanks,
J
