The heatherlock deal had a single transaction agreement attached to it. When
The contract ended the deal ended.
The other two I believe we just need a email from vance or donald setting up
A spot ticket.
Vance could you look into that? Do I have the wrong contract attached? Or
Is there a new contract. For camden & north central, are those just going to
Be spot tickets?
