Per the request of the management team, attached is a form to assist managers
In documenting performance improvement guidelines for poor performers. There
Are two pages: page one is the template with a brief description of the
Information needed on it. Page two is a completed example to show how it
Might look when finished.
Please begin working with the appropriate manager in completing the document
For those individuals who have a ranking of needs improvement or issues for
