Daren:
Can you shed a little light on this tenaska iv deal? James armstrong is
Telling me that we should have a purchase deal in the system to pay tenaska
Iv for the 9/00 and 10/00 gas that we are marketing for them. I do not see a
Deal in path manager for either month. I also need some detail on who we are
Buying and selling this gas from and to. There are a number of
Counterparties at lonestar for ena and i' m not sure which ones go with this
Deal. Is there a schedule you can email to me? James is looking for an
Answer today on the tenaska iv payment, so whatever you can tell me will be
Appreciated.
Thanks,
Megan
