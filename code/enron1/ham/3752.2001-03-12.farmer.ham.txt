Gas accounting is initiating a project to ensure consistent treatment of
Physical storage between flash and the gl. To that end, please provide the
Book codes and cost of inventory schedules that you have for each of the
Physical storage facilities. We will also need what you show as the 1/31/01
Inventory balance for each.
David,
I believe that we already have the information for bammel. Please provide
The info for other texas desk storage, if any.
I would like to have this information as soon as possible.
Thanks, everyone.
