I' m trying to get this to pull through to unify for payment to spinnaker. Volume management shows" no detail".
Sitara indicated 685 mmbut 4/1 - 4/30 expected.
Who needs to talk to who to get this fixed.
Payment must be set up by noon 5/24/01 for prompt payment to spinnaker.
Thank you and please advise.

Subject: cowtrap allocation - 4/01
I received the above allocation for this deal where there is a purchase from spinnaker and a sale to dow. The volumes have not be actualized so there is nothing in volume management. Can one of you look into this and get back to me.
Thanks,
Joyce
