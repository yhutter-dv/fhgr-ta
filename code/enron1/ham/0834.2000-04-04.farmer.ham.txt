Subject: 98 - 9794 (saxet)
The above meter is currently doing 13. 0 on a 26. 0 nom.
Please take a look and see if nom adjustments might be a solution.
Looking@ deal #109670, the terms indicates that hplc buys 2. 5% of saxet
Volumes. Should I assume that I should take the total flow amount (per day
For this deal ticket) and adjust the expected volumes to reflect a nom that
Is 2% of the daily flow versus the" 1" that is currently nomed?
H - e - l - p!!!
Thanks
