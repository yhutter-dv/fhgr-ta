There have been so many cilco issues until i' m not sure which one you are
Referencing. If it relates to the cilco sale that has created the large
Receivable balance, then we are waiting on a response from daren. I met with
Daren and kenny and we all agree that the sale between ena - tx and cilco is
Invalid and that the sale has to be with the storage book (your group will
Not have to do anything with this sale). The problem lies in the associated
Transport with that sale. This is the piece that we need daren' s help on. I
Will touch base with daren and see if we can get this resolved this week. If
This is not what you are referring to, please let me know. Thanks!

Lisa, no I have not seen the adjustments come across for the summer months
(off - peak) that we talked about at the meeting last month. Rita wynn' s group
(fred b.) is making the volume adjustments in unify volume management and
That has not been made as of last week when I talked to him. If you have any
Questions about this you might get with rita are fred.
Thanks, jeff
