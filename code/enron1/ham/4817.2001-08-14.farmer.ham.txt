Subject: what the heck
Daren,
Now what? I see ken is back and jeff is out. What a development. Jeff has a lot of his bud' s in high places. Could be many changes on the horizon.
How you doing? Moved to new building yet? I' ll be looking for my tour invitation.
How' s the kids, wife, and home (read that work project)?
Jen is home for a couple of weeks before heading back to waco. We are going up there to tour the new law school (built with tobacco settlement money - - so we feel like contributators). She has four quarters down and 5 maybe 6 to go.
Son still in florida. We plan to run over there in september for a few days. Maybe do disneyworld.
JenI is supposed to get us tickets to the nebraska game in waco this year. That should be fun. Speaking of football, I see one texas team high in the polls. The other???????
I got a new toy the other day. Sears had a good sale on a power washer i' ve had my eye on, so I bought it. Just did the patio and deck. God, I thought painting was mindless work.....................
Also, found out from insurance company they will be funding an entirely new roof (hail damage???). I don' t like the mess from that project but as old roof was a layover the old shake shingles I will be glad to get rid of that and get decking down on roof.
Know you are busy. Let me know the latest when you have time.
Later,
Ken
