Subject: cleburne plant
Well, folks, the cleburne deal has started. The deal has not been finalized
Through legal. However, we were able to" get between" a few deals and make
Some money before we finalized it. The cleburne plant was down 7/31 - 8/7 and
8/31. On these dates, we bought gas from tenaska iv texas partners and sold
To anp and tenaska marketing. Because things were not set up, I could not
Enter the deals until now. Please review the following deals and settle with
The customers.
