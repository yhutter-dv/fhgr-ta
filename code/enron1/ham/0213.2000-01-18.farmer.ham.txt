A solution. Unfortanuately, this whole thing was missed, until susan started
Asking for a ticket.

Julie,
I have received the partially executed committed reserves contract from
Etoco. The contract not only has meter #9614 attached to it but also meters
9651 & 9672. We will generate a ticket to be entered into sitara asap.

What is the status of this meter. This was the deal that was under etoco.
Have we gotten a ticket setup yet?

Julie, will there be a new deal/contract set up for this meter? There are
Valid actuals for 1/1 and 1/2 and I need to allocate these volumes to a
Contract otherwise I will keep getting an allocation exception error.
Thanks, susan.

Julie,
Per our conversation yesterday, the deals/contracts associated with this
Meter have been terminated as of 12/31/99. Please let me know what the
Status is on this matter because the meter is still active and flowing and
There is no contract to allocate to.
Thanks,
Susan
