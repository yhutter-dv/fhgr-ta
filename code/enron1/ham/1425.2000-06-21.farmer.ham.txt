Subject: desk summary report
The cpr report named desk summary is currently being reviewed for an
Upgrade. I have been told that this report is used during bidweek to check
Positions on a particular pipe (for a particular zone). If you do not need
Additional data, this report could very easily be added to the report
Selection in the sitara reporting application. If anyone would like to see
More detailed information on the report, please let me know. There may be a
Report that is already in production that they can access.
Please let me know if the format currently in cpr is sufficient as soon as
Possible.
Chao!
