Subject: re: meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
Mary,
Hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december,
1999. Typically, before hpl physically pulls a meter, production has ceased
At minimum for 6 months or the production has been released. In the case of
The roos common point, the producing wells were released and attached to
Meter 0989740 in 11/98 and the remaining wells are non - producing.
Resultingly, the only viable option for resolution is option 2. We should
Take the deal to zero by" unwinding" it.

Vance:
Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal,
Depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not.
Producing: if that is the case, the purchase from calpine, and any contracts
Hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level.
Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads
Were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal. This will
Probably have to go back to hplc' s ownership of hplr' s gathering assets.
Non - producing: should we determine that the common point and any wells
Behind it have been shut - in, or p & a' d, we will need to reallocate this deal
To zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another
Deal, if possible. Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced
Contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
In a financial loss).
In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
At meter 4229, which I am currently looking into. I will email you as soon
As I ascertain that date.
In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals
Which were impacted by hplc' s aquisition of hplr' s gathering to ensure that
They are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing
Level. Please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
This.
Thank you again for all of your hard work in this area,
Mary
