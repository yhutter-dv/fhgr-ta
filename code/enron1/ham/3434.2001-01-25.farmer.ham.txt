Subject: basin production from ga 213
I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
From ga 213. While spl' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
F at 400 psig, it is both my and john handley' s opinion that the gas from the
Wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken. We expect
The dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher. However, this was the best
Sample that could be obtained at the time. We have conferred with steve
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
Next couple of days. Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows
Stablilized and mitchell' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
Couple of days, hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
Have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
Basis. Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f, then this
Production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
Equipment has been installed. In the meantime, hms needs to keep a close
Watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
Liquids fallout.
