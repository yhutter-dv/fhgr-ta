Subject: 98 - 6892 for 3/15/2000 and 3/23/2000
Daren,
I know it' s first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3/15 (71
Dec.) and 3/23 (35 dec.) but the deal (sitara #213005) doesn' t cover these
Two days.
Can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in sitara so that i
Can clear my exceptions for volume management?
Thanks
