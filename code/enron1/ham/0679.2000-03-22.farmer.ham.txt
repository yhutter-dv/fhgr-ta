Subject: meter #0989814 - gmt, inc. - 1/00 production
Stephanie,
The problem with the january payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly
In sitara. For january production deal 153864 shows hplc purchasing gas
From gmt company inc, not gmt inc. Someone needs to either correct the deal
For 1/00 or put in a new deal, then I can do an accounting arrangement to
Make the necessary correction. It is correct for 2/00 on deal 156292. I
Emailed daren on this because I see his name in sitara as the contact, but i
Am not sure who actually takes care of it.

Thu,
I' m not sure if this is your meter or not. If it is not, could you please
Pass this email on to the correct person.
For meter #9814, jan. 2000 production, the volume was allocated to the wrong
Company. The gas was allocated to gmt company inc., but it should have been
Allocated to gmt, inc. For feb. 2000 it is done correctly.
I need to recoup the money from gmt company, so could you please let me know
When the change has been made in the system.
Thanks for your help.
Stephanie (3 - 6004)

Nick, it appears that we paid gmt company, inc. (ba 01474) of corpus christi
Instead of gmt, inc. (ba 75046) of houston. These companies are not
Related. We should pay the houston gmt for production at meter 098 - 9814.
Would you please make the necessary adjustments? Thanks.

Cindy, gmt has advised brian that they have not yet received payment for
Production at meter 098 - 9814 for the period from 1/14/2000 to 1/31/2000.
Would you look into this and have them paid as promptly as possible? It
Appears that the january deal was 156292 and I believe gmt produced 15, 984
Mmbtu in january.

Brian, for your information. Please note robert' s cautionary warning with
Respect to additional wells that gmt may want to drill and add to this
Meter. Does gmt have additional drilling plans? If so, should we alert them
To the gas quality issue early on?

Although the gas is non - spec, the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough
That it can be blended okay before reaching beaumont. Go for it.
As a precaution, we are starting a trend and I want to be very cautious.
Once we connect a well, we can' t go backwards. Please be specific with gmt
And limit him to this one well. Otherwise he could drill more wells and flow
Them all through this new meter.
