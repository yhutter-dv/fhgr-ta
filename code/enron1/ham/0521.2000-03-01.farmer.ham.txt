On january 15 and 16, hpl bought some gas from western gas resources at the
Aquila header (10. 000 and 5. 000 mmbtu' s respectively). This was a late

On the stranger' s gas contract. However, deal ticket #143709 was never
Updated to reflect those late changes. Please let me know if you want me to
Update the deal ticket. Thanks, susan.
