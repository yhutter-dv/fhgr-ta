Daren,
I talked to vance and he said it was the same well that he nominated during bidweek. I will ask julie to change the price to gas daily. Thanks.

Bob,
I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek. If it is, then we do need to change the price to gd. If it is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.
