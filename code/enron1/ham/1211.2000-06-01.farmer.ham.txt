Mtr. #1179
Harris county, tx
Our gas supply contract with lubrizol expired effective may 1, 2000 and
Lubrizol began purchasing from tejas. Lubrizol has decided not to execute a
Keep - ready agreement with hpl to keep this meter on stand - by. Therefore,
Please take the necessary steps to classify this meter as' inactive' and
Insure that no future volumes flow through this meter.
Charlie - we will leave this station in place for now and try to recapture
This market in three years. Please have this station locked and secured as
Soon as possible to prevent lubrizol from taking any unauthorized volumes
Should tejas be unable to deliver gas for any reason.
Thanks, gerald (#39919)
