Daren - did we have a purchase from beaumont methonal on 2/9? I show a deal
Of 5. 000 on deal 611178. I confirmed a total of 13. 000 (deal 603107) for
That day. Were we buying back 5. 000 or was the deal reduced to 13000?

Ok thanks! Will be there shortly. Also, joanie received a call from beaumont
Stating that there is a sale to hpl on 2/9 for 5, 000 mmbtu. This was
Reflected on the supply draft and buddy majorrwitz looked into this before
He/we released invoice and said that there were no sales to hpl from
Beaumont. Do you have any support or documentation re: any/all 02/01 prod.
Sales to hpl? If so, can I also get a copy of that support to fax to
Customer?

I still handle meter 1428. I checked my notes for 2/13. There was an
Intraday change from 18. 000 to 0. When it was changed to 0, the meter had
Already flowed 3. 811. It is a valid volume. If you have anymore questions,
Please let me know.

Aimee )
Per conversation with rosa brown and thu (in volumes management, beaumont
Methanol is a swing deal, by which the gas sales allocations are handled by
The scheduletr. Thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter #981428.
Do you still handle the sales allocations for hpl meter #981428? If so, can
You confirm 02 - 01 sales (on hpl, meter #981428., sales deal #603107), to
Beaumont methanol (which we , ve invoiced them), vs. Chyral hankins , e - mial to
Buddy majorwitz below? The only date that is really in question is sales for
Flow date 02 - 13 - 01 (she reflects noms of 0 vs. The 3, 811 mmbtu that we
Invoiced them).
Thanks,
Tess ray
