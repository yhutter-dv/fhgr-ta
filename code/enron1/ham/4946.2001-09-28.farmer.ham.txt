Subject: fw: the odds are against them
There is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we' ve all
Witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks, but when you look at the
Following numbers and realize how much worse it could' ve been, I guess there
Are a lot of people who were saved...
Subject: the odds are against them
By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
And reports of the
Destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us.
These were deplorable
Acts
That we will never forget. But now is a time to look
At the other side of
The
Numbers coming out of new york, washington and
Pennsylvania. The sad
But somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
Media has not reported yet
- the survival rates and some positive news about
The attacks.
* * * the buildings * * *
* the world trade center -
The twin towers of the world trade center were
Places of employment for
Some
50, 000 people. With the missing list of just over
5, 000 people, that means
90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A
90% on a test is an' a'.
* the pentagon -
Some 23, 000 people were the target of a third plane
Aimed at the pentagon.
The latest count shows that only 123 lost their
Lives. That is an amazing
99. 5% survival rate. In addition, the plane seems to
Have come in too low,
Too early to affect a large portion of the building.
On top of that, the
Section that was hit was the first of five sections
To undergo renovations
That would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
Attacks. It had
Recently
Completed straightening and blastproofing, saving
Untold lives. This attack
Was sad, but a statistical failure.
* * * the planes * * *
* american airlines flight 77
This boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
The pentagon could have
Carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard.
Luckily 78% of the seats
Were empty.
* american airlines flight 11
This boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
Aboard, but only carried
92.
Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled.
* united airlines flight 175
Another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
Only had 65 people on
Board. Fortunately it was 81% empty.
* united airlines flight 93
This boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
Stories yet. The smallest
Flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
Of a possible 289 had
84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood
Up to the attackers and
Thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
National landmark, saving
Untold numbers of lives in the process.
* * * in summary * * *
Out of potentially 74, 280 americans directly
Targeted by these inept
Cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That' s
A higher survival rate
Than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney
Transplants and liver transplants
- all common, survivable illnesses.
The hijacked planes were mostly empty, the pentagon
Was hit at it' s
Strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people
In the world trade
Center buildings escaped, and a handful of
Passengers gave the ultimate
Sacrifice to save even more lives.
Pass this information on to those in fear and the
Media. Don' t fear these
Terrorists. The odds are against them.
