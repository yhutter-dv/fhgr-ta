Subject: southern union
I combined the tickets for the southern union plants at port arthur and
Galveston for april forward to accurately reflect the contract. The new
Sitara number is 224490, and the old numbers are: 17832 andl 09216. This
Change will allow for a more accurate estimate in our p & l as well as more
Accurate invoicing. I believe that this change will reduce our monthly
Variances due to these deals. If you have any questions or concerns please
Feel free to give me a call
