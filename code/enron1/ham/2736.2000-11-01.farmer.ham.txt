Subject: 6/4/99 and 6/9/99 (98 - 0439) enerfin tetco
Daren,
On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the enerfin meter.
6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ena (202 k). Can the deal be extended
For 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that volume
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?
Thanks
