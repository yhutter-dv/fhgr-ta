If the plants become an external counterparty, the fee should probably go
Back to the
Scale in the original contract. The assumption being that the original plant
Financing could afford
The escalating fee.
Let me know if you want me to look into it any further.
Thanks

Darren,
How are things going? Just a note to reiterate what we talked about
Yesterday. Rick hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee
Was for an outside counterparty. This admin fee would be for the life of the
Project (through 2019). Also, mike mazowita should be calling you to talk
About the plant being down this week through the end of the month. Please
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks.
John
