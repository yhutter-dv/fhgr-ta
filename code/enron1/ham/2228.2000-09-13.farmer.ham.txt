Subject: budget questionaire - update
One more thing - next year you will be billed for inhouse training - please
Include these classes with the other training your are scheduleing. If you
Give the class, I will put in the costs (thanks to jeff sorenson for asking
About
This)
I forgot to mention this - when you are putting in your salries -
Do not include analsyst salaries!!!
These are charged at a specific amount to your rc, regardless of the
Actual salary of the analsyt. Just give me the total salaries of any
Non - analysts, and the number of analysts you have. I will put in the
Salary allocations for the analysts (about $4, 000 per month).
Thanks, diane
