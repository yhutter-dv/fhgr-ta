Damn!!!! What are you guys doing down there. I leave you alone and the place goes to hell in a hand - basket.
I' m sure glad my portfolio is diversified into stocks that have lost even more money than enron (chuckle).
Hang in there......... This has happened before. If it gets bad enough call me and i' ll buy you lunch.

P. S. I finally get to see my beloved huskers in waco this year. It is not the same as mecca (lincoln), but it' ll do. Besides we will have more red there than baylor green.
