Subject: ena 202 and hpl 216 transport contracts needed at meter 378 for
March 2000
Daren - would there be a problem if I created a desk to desk for meter 378
For march 2000 going forward? It would help out with the allocation
Process. The kind of deal I need is the total opposite of deal #115101.
Please let me know if there is a problem. Volume management would like this
Done today. Thanls.

Aimee:
The ena 012 - 27049 - 02 - 002 and hpl 012 - 41500 - 02 - 016 contract are not at meter
378 for march 2000. I need for you to put the correct deal number for both
Contracts in path manager.
We need the ena 202 contract as a delivery and the hpl 216 as a receipt.
Please get the deal in the system this morning and let me know what the deal
Numbers are and I will set up the arraignments and let you know what the
Track id' s are.
Thanks,
Fred
