Subject: fw: executed agency - ena and tenaska gas company
I' m having trouble understanding this. Is she referring to the unsigned agency agreement between ena and tenaska iv texas partners, ltd. (aka ponderosa pine energy partners), an agency agreement between ena and lone star (i' m not familiar w/the name txu gas distribution), or an agreement between any of the former and tenaska gas, either relating to the cleburne project or otherwise????

Subject: executed agency - ena and tenaska gas company
I am searching for an executed agency agreement between ena and tenaska gas company. Ena is agent on the txu gas distribution pipeline.
This agency agreement relates to contract no. 1671 and contract no. 1856 on the txu gas distribution pipeline.
Please let me know if either of you are in possession of this agency agreement.
Thank you.
