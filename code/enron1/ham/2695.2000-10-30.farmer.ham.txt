Subject: october deals
Daren,
I have 2 allocation exceptions that require a deal to be extended. Meter
98 - 1488 tenaska is showing small volumes flowed on days there was no deal.
Can you extend the deal throughout the month so that the volumes will have a
Deal to link to. I have the same situation on meter 98 - 1601.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks,
Susan
