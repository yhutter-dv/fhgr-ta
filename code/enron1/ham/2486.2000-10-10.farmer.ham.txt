Subject: koch midstream services co
I have been billing koch midstream services co under ena for meters
Ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas (sitara #144052) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe (sitara #144049). My
Former accounting contact at koch, michael thomas, said that koch sold these
South texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999. Michael faxed
A contract which I forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
Area. Cindy said she can' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
She can' t recognize the assignment. Cindy has left messages with koch, but
She has not been able to resolve the issue. Koch is refusing to pay for
The gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
These deals. I need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
Paying for this gas. Do you have any information regarding this issue?
Thanks,
Tina valadez
