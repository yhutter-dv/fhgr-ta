Subject: enron methanol
For maro 0, siatar #139055, you will need to make adjustments to the risk
Assignments etc., as I have made some changes to the booked deal.
For march 1 to 10, enron methanol will take zero volumes (they will be down
For maintenance - a force majeure situation)
For march 11 to 31, they will take 33, 000/d at a price of gas daily hsc mid
Flat.
Thanks
Lee
