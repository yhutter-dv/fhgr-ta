With the following counterparties as the ones to which ena is selling gas off
Of hpl' s pipe.
Altrade transaction, l. L. C. Gulf gas utilities company
Brazoria, city of panther pipeline, inc.
Central illinois light company praxair, inc.

Since i' m not sure exactly what gets entered into sitara, pat clynes
Suggested that I check with daren farmer to make sure that i' m not missing
Something (which I did below). While I am waiting for a response from him
And/or mary smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the
Above contracts.

Subject: ena sales on hpl
I am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
Could tell me if i' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
Which she is looking.
She is trying to draft a long - term transport/storage agreement between ena &
Hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets. In order to
Accomplish this, she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
Doing off of hpl' s pipe.
I had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy/sell activity
On hpl since 7/99. If I eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals, will
This give me everything that I need?
Are there buy/sell deals done with ena on hpl' s pipe that wouldn' t show up in
Sitara? Someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
On it' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
????? Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in sitara?
Is there anything else that i' m missing? I' m not real familiar with how some
Of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
Ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer!!!
Thanks in advance.
