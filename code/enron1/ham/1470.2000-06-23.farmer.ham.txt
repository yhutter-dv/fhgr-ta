We should sit and discuss the processes involved in creating new,
Unprecedented product types in eol, as I think it is important for you to
Understand the myriad of processes involved. To start with, legal will
Absolutely need to be involved, as it sounds like a new gtc is in order.
Please call either sherI thomas or I when you are ready to discuss the new
Product.

Steve -
One issue that immediately comes to mind is the' general terms and
Conditions' ability to handle intra - day nominations.. This may require a new
Product type and gtc.
Are we presently trading this product otc, or is this unprecedented?
