Daren, sitara has two different prices for may 31, 2001 causing a problem.
According to lee papayoti, the price for the swing volumes should
Behsc _ flw + 1 high. Gdp. D. A. However it is priced at hsc. Gdp. D. A with the 31 st
Being priced at both. This is causing settlements to be overstated by
419 mmbtu and $1, 432. 66. Any help you could give would be greatly
Appreciated. My phone #is 713 - 571 - 3273.

I tried to get into the sitara ticket #373590 to correct the swing pricing
.... But I am not allowed to access it beacuse it is a deal from when we
Were at enron and I can' t access those deals....
Please ask joanie or somebody as to what to try next, as I am at a loss!!
