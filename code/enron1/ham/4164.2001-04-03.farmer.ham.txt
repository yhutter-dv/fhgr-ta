Subject: lacy' s eye exam
HI bubba!
Lacy got her eye exam yesterday. He said that she is very near sighted, but
The diabetes has not affected her eyes at all. That was a relief. She' s been
Having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood
Sugars being out of control. She is doing so much better now. I have
Stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much
Better. She' s acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me. I
Guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was
Wrong with her. She doesn' t say the cruel things to me that she used to. I
Knew something had to be wrong with her. I thought surely I had not raised a
Child with such a mean spirit. Anyway things are a lot better.
Tell cole that mimI hopes his eye appointment goes as well as lacy' s. Let
Him call to tell me about it. I hope he gets his teary eye" fixed".
Lacy' s eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes.
He couldn' t believe her teeth are so perfect without braces. And she is so
Tanned, you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she
Smiles. She has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next
Week. We' ll talk later about when we are coming to your house. I' m going to
Longview to a singles retreat sat. In case you call & i' m not there. Will be
Home sat. Night. Love ya, maw
