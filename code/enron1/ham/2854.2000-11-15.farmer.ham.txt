Subject: gulf plains
Imbalance update: I spoke with mike bilberry and confirmed that this deal
Really is energy in/energy out. We should not be impacted in any way by a
Reallocation to correct pvr percentages or a c 5 correction at the plant.
Hpl/ena should rereceive the same volume, dth for dth at the residue or at a
Redelivery point such as lobo/agua. I have left a message for my counterpart
At duke and am requesting that they deliver to us, somewhere, an additional
20, 125 dth/day for the month of december to balance us out.
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. I will advise
Everyone upon their agreement to payback so that our respective positions
Reflect the additional supply.
