Subject: estimate file updates
Dave,
Please have steve remove the meters in the following list from the estimate
File. These were accounting meters set up to represent the offsetting
Physical meters. The physical meters should still receive estimates.
If you have any questions please call.
Gary

Gary,
Could you please remove scada/mips from the following hpl meters. These
Meters are where mid - texas interconnects with
Pg & e' s system, and there should not be any measurement taking place on hpl.
These meters were set up originally when we thought
That every meter on mid - texas should automatically have a corresponding meter
On hpl. This assumption is now incorecct.
