Daren,
A sale to oxy vinyls went into effect 10/01 through 10/16 for 5, 000 per day.
We also delivered gas to entex, 10, 000/day for the entire month. More gas
Was pulled towards the end of the month than confirmed and I need to know if
Oxy vinyls should get the swing for the remaining of the month even though
Their deal went to zero. Please advise.
Susan
