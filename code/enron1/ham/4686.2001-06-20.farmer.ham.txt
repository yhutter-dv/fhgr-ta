Elizabeth,
Deal #649741 is a 05/01 sale to bp energy. Bp is claiming that this deal should have been invoiced by hpl and not ena. My contact also claims that this was confirmed by gary lamphier. I am not sure if gary is with ena or hpl. Is this something you can look into or do I need to send this to someone else?
Thanks,
Genaro
