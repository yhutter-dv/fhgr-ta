Ow,
I went through the list on the sort by pipe and highlighted the curves/mapping we can delete (yellow) and those we can change (orange). The only curves we will have left are katy, waha, hsc, agua dulce, and thompsonville. I expect to be using thompsonville in 6 months to a year. If it easier or cleaner to delete that curve and add it when we need it, that will be fine. Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey gang,
Attached are the physical curve mappings as provided by russ severson... Please take a peek and let us know if we need to change, add/delete, update any points/mappings going forward in a netco environment... For instance, I would like to change texoma to carthage on the curve mappings... Also, I would like to delete all derived curves, leaving only carthage, katytailgate, and agua dulce.
The other physical locations would be shipchannel, waha and katy (non - tailgate)... Let me know your thoughts... O' neal 3 - 9686
