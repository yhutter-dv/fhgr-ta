Subject: 75 th anniversary celebration
Thank you for your fantastic responses to our reservations request. There
Has been some confusion concerning the dinner only option. If you are
Planning to spend the night, you do not need to respond to that option. It
Is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night.
We are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the hpl
Anniversary celebration. Please email me with the name you would like to
Appear on your nametag, such as nicknames, etc. If we do not hear from you
By wednesday, august 2, we will use the name as it appears in the list we
Acquired from hr. Please print this memo for any employees who do not have
Access to email.
Thank you so much for your help.
