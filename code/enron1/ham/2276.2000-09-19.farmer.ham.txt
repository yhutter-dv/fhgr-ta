Subject: wholesale volumes - august
It' s that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!
The database for august is now ready for viewing. Just as a reminder, this
Is the shortcut on your desktop called" statistical database".
As there is continued investor focus on our wholesale operations, investor
Relations requests that business analysis & reporting provide monthly
Volumetric analysis for wholesale operations in addition to the quarterly
Analysis. Please review the analysis for august 2000 and provide
Explanations for all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year,
Quarter/quarter, and month/month variances. The current objective of
Investor relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential
Investor or analyst questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and
Presentations. It is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial
Personnel.
Please forward your verification and explanations via e - mail to me by 10: 00 am
Friday, september 22. Please feel free to call with any questions.
Thanks,
Misti
