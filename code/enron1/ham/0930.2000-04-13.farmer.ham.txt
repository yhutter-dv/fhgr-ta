Jackie:
Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the hpl liquids contract
012 - 41970 - 02 - 002 in march 2000. Also last month when you were out, robert
Removed the volume from the liquids contract at this meter and temporarily
Put it on a strangers gas contract. If you could fix both months today and
Let me know when it is corrected I would appreciate it.
Thanks,
Fred

Jackie:
I am new at the 3 rivers allocation so bear with me, I took this over from
Anita luong. In january 2000, and going forward, please make sure that
Meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the hpl liquids contract
012 - 41970 - 02 - 002. The contract is currently out of balance by the total
Volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning
I would appreciate it.
Thanks,
Fred
