Subject: organisational announcement - introducing enron global markets
As evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter,
Enron , s wholesale energy businesses in north america and europe continue to
Experience tremendous growth. The opportunities to continue to grow our
Natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to
Enron , s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses
And maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.
It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of
Gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnings
Growth. We have made significant progress in developing these businesses in
North america, europe, and most recently in our new net works business unit.
Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products,
Coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest rates, credit
Trading, paper and pulp, and metals.
