Subject: tenaska iv 11/00
I am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
Lone star. We have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $0. 01
Transport rate. We received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
Agree with our deal. They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0. 10 and meter
20014903 at $0. 02. These meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 384258
And the tenaska marketing deal 459898, respectively. Should our deal match
What txu is billing or is there another deal that I am missing? I haven' t
Worked with transport very much, so I could be confused. I think we have
This problem with oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet. I am going
To look at it this afternoon. Tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
Txu transport, so we will need to pay this next week.
Also, now that we have the actuals for nov 2000, we need to update the demand
Fees to reflect the correct volumes. Barring any changes, I have listed the
Adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet. The unify adjustments will be
Over by about $20. 00 from the spreadsheet. I thought it would be better have
The cleburne desk at zero, than to leave a balance.
1. Deal 529856 - change 11/1 demand fee from $341, 250. 47 to $493, 365. 74
(difference $152, 115. 27)
2. Deal 529856 - change 11/2 demand fee from $167, 062. 50 to $159, 721. 55
(difference $7, 340. 95)
3. Deal 514353 - change agency fee volume from 45, 000/day to 45, 016/day
(difference $19. 72)
Thanks,
