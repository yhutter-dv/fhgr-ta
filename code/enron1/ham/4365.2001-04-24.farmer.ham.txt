Bob,
Questions based on the information in the facilitation by location report:
1. Meter 9643 hgpl/hpl - stratton, tejones operating corporation, sitara 266970: should this purchase be at meter 9638, freeman prod - maxine field in trade zone 18?
2. I presume we are not counting both meter 9848 north padre island blk 8 and meter 9862 lehman/spinnaker onshore. Isn' t this the same gas?
3. Meter 3536 seahawk/a - s (mat plt 520), eog resources, sitara 725391: is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?
4. Meter 6884 pgtt junction 16" lease, comstock oil & gas, inc. And kerr - mcgee oil & gas onshore l. P., sitara 125899 and 132975: comstock' s volume should exceed kerr - mcgee' s volume, and together the two volumes should be approximately 73, 000/d. Currently, comstock' s volume is only 8, 600/d and kerr - mcgee' s volume is 25, 000/d. We look about 38, 000/d short.
5. Meter 639 hannah nash, coral energy resources, l. P., sitara 659998: is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?
I' m looking at about 10 other old deals that I think should be in for may, but aren' t. In addition, i' m adding in the new deals that will flow in may. I' ll be done by noon.
