Subject: cilco pathing - withdrawl and hplc transport pathing
Hey guys,
Just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue. While I agree that
Howard, robert and george needed to work on this together, I do not think
That howard should have been the driving force behind this. Once we left the
Meeting, they all convened on the 37 th floor and worked from howard' s desk -
With howard sitting down doing much of the work. I also think that the below
E - mail should not have come from howard, but should have originated out of
The logistics group. I understand that howard has prior scheduling
Experience, but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially
Took on that role in getting this set up correctly. He too had to sit down
And try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly
(?). In my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up, but I am
Concerned at the role that he played. Team effort is important and it' s what
We all want between our groups, but I want to ensure that everyone does their
Fair share and expectations are appropriately placed. Let me know what you
Both think. Thanks!
