Subject: 98 - 2601
HI daren,
I' m attempting to clear the above mentioned meter from an error report
(revenue volume comparison report). Howard apprised me, in a meeting last
Week, that the reason this meter is appearing in the aforementioned report is
Due to no volumes being scheduled in pops but volumes appearing in mops. The
Volumes@ this meter is for 4449 (sitara deal tickets 240095 and 227697. Due
To this being a" check meter" the volumes will not bridge to pops from mops.
I' d like to request to revise the nome of 4449 to show" 0" instead. Can you
Approve this modification?
Thanks
