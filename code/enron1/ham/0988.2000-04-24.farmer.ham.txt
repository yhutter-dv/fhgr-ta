Subject: meter #1591 lamay gaslift
Daren - meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom. This meter is has been
Over nominated. It has had a nom of 1. 000/day (429. 000 total mmbtus) since
1/28/99 and has flowed only 11. 692. Am I correct to say that this meter
Needs a lower nom? Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom
In may. Pat seems to think this may be affecting the p/l for april. We only
Have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2.
Please let me know if this makes sense.

Aimee,
Please check meter #1591 lamay gas lift. It doesn' t appear to have very much
Flow and the
Bav is showing the nom volume. This could be adversely affecting the risk
