Subject: shell meters for october
I have confirmed with rusty at shell for october. Expected flows by meter
Are as follows:
1060 - east low pressure: 35 m
1061 - west low pressure: om
1095 - shell south: 40 m
1581 - shell high pressure: 15 m
The numbers may flip around in a couple of weeks, after they bring some units
Back on at meter 1581. We need to just be sure that they keep a rate between
Points of 90 m/day.
Please let me know if you have any questions, comments.
Thank you,
Mary
