Subject: 06/01 ena gas sales on hpl, to d & h gas company
Good morning daren:
I received a fax from d & h for 06/01 deliveries (hplc sales to d & h), however
There is no sales draft in unify for this sale. Please advise if the 360
Mmbtu reflected on d & h' s 06/01 allocations, for hpl meter #428 - deweyville.
Tx. A valid hplc sale and if so, who do I contact about getting deal in
Sitara and scheduled for hplc, so as to invoice d & h this month!
Thanks!
