Reminders
Request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and
Contributions to your group. Tell them the information they forward to you
Will better help you in representing them.
The focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and
Will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to
Everyone else in their peer group.
Update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key
Highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports
So that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your
Direct report. It is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session
With your direct report if he/she already knows what the key areas of needed
Development are. An ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which
Employees with performance issues (can' t do or won' t do) choose to exit the
Group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given.
I will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available.
Let me know if you have any questions.
