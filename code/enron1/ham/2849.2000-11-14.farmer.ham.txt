Subject: beaumont methanol - meter 1428 - october 2000
Ladies and gents:
On sat oct 21, hpl meter #1428 had a malfunction, and started flowing at a
Very high rate, way over the nominated rate of 18, 000/d (gas control will
Confirm this).
Since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective, I told
Gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed, by cutting
Back to a lower flow rate.
So we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23, saturday through monday. The three day total for the meter is 59, 067
Mmbtu. Beaumont methanol nominated 54, 000 mmbtu (i. E. 18, 000/d for 3
Days). We should allocate a total of 54, 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
The three days, and the 5, 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
Under sitara #484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint.
Please call with questions.
Thanks
Lee
