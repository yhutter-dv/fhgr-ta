No one resolved this. It still needs to be done. You, robert, and volume
Management need to be involved for november. You and robert can take care of
Dec. If you need more input let me know.
Thanks

In november volume was applied to deal #92963 when, in fact, all volume
Should be on 125066. Please effect this change asap and insure december is
Set up for 125066. Deal #92963 should have been terminated at the end of
October.
Thanks
