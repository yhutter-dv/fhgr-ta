Thanks for following up on this.
I think we' re generally there in terms of the commercial terms, but need to
Think through just a few issues related to our plans for the asset.
I' d suggest we meet on thursday as I believe the asset manager (mike
Mazowita) will be here in houston. In addition to john' s list of attendees,
Chuck ward, john king and I should be in the meeting. I' ll ask tina tennant
To corrdinate.

Rick,
Just following up my voicemail to you yesterday - - - john griffith has
Contacted me regarding the gas management agreement relating to the
Cornhusker transaction. When dan was in my office several weeks ago, we spoke
With you and it appeared that some of the financial terms of the gas
Management agreement were yet to be worked out - - has that occurred yet? Do you
Know the details of the extension on the transition agreement? Are you
Available to meet on this in the next day or two and is there anyone else you
Think should be included? (john griffith has asked to be included and
Suggests darren farmer and bob hall be present as well) - - please let me know
Thank you,
Sandi
