Clem,
I have completed setting the confirm = 0 for 986892 and reallocated
All the days. They are all zero now, however 10/4/2000 and 10/5/2000
Still have a non - zero bav, these should get set to 0 by 10/6. Since
Allocation will not allocate these days till 10/6 gas date.

This could create some problems for gas control, because all confirmed
Volumes will be zeroed including october, 2000 activities at meter 986892
Today (10/4/00). This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at
Meter #980439.
Daren:
This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should
Clear within 24 to 48 hours.
