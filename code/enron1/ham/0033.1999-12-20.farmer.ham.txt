I' m sorry, did we discuss bmc???.
Lee can confirm the accuracy of this, but bmc bought 20, 000 from us and
Intended no swing and no buyback. Brandywine (dorcheus) controlled the meter,
Therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders. I
Believe a deal is in place with brandywine to cover that very issue for
November. If not please let me know.
Lee, if this is not your understanding for nov. Business please let us all
Know.
Thanks

Lee,
I need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue.
First, you show a deal volume of 20, 000 on nov. 7 and the pipeline confirmed
This volume. Is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol? This
Volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says, the volume confirmed by
Hpl, and dorcheus' s volume.
Second, the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
Julie meyers notes she sends out every month (last note sent dec 3 and you
Are on distribution list). Brandywine has nothing to do with this issue. It
Is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol.
Do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
Buyback?
This is a commercial issue that I need further clarification from you if you
Have a buyback in place or not. If not, please notify julie and note on the
Deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective.
If it is still active, please contact chyral and resolve.
Let me know the final resolution.
Hc

I don' t have all the data that you have in front of you and so am not in a
Position to call bob dorcheus.... Please call him directly at 281 - 293 - 1789

Something that was a surprise to her. Again, this an allocation issue
Between beaumont methanol and brandywine.... Please call chyral at
