Aquila split the volume between two points, that is why the deal changed.
The total volume was still correct. I just found out today, from stacie,
That a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title
Tracking agreement. I had previously been under the impression that
Whatever pipeline the customer wanted, buy or sell, was fine with us.
However, keeping the purchases on hub agmts. Will save enron
$. 0025/transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier.
