Subject: weekend oncall notes
Friday 1/19/01 - received a call from sheila at basin regarding a well which
May be coming on this weekend (meter 9696). Phone lee in gas control
Regarding same. Lee informed me that hpl would prefer that the volumes are
Not brought on until a field tech can pull a sample and verify that there are
No liquids involved. Lee further informed me that the same day to tejas at
Hardy was not in the system, and, per gary hanks, needed to be corrected.
Lee informed me that the volumes were actually split 10 m at hardy/tejas and
10 m at lomax. I went into sitara and updated the deal ticket, pathed and
Nominated over to pops.
Saturday 1/20/01 - 8: 30 am sean paged regarding the nomination at dow
Freeport, he was questioning the validity, as we do not often flow at this
Meter. I checked and the nomination was good for saturday' s gas day. Sean
Informed me that the valero refinery was up and down and would be going
Completely down on sunday.
10: 00 am - sean called regarding tejas laporte, meter 665. Apparently, the
Meter had a confirmed volume of 20 m and hpl/ena had no deal at the meter.
Checked in pops and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20 m on a deal
Volume of zero. Informed sean that the tejas volume was confirmed. Also,
Per sean koch george west (meter 6722) had a nomination increase of 10 m,
Which he wanted to confirm.
Sunday 1/21/01 10: 00 am sean paged regarding the dow meter 1442, pops still
Showed a confirmed voume of 10 m which dow and oasis showed at zero for
Sunday. I checked the system and confirmed that the meter was indeed at
Zero and phoned sean back to confirm. Checked on mtp hardy, sean informed me
That we came in on rate for saturday and that current meter activity looked
Good.
