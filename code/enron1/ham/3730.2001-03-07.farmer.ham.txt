Eric,
I recieved a call from a guy with pacific interlink (?). He is looking to
Market lng in europe. Since I have very little knowledge in this area, i
Didn' t get much specific information. But, I told him I would find someone
For him to talk with. His name is sam kovacevich. Phone: 847 - 971 - 3369. I
Would appreciate it if you would give sam a call. If you aren' t the person
He needs to talk to, please let me know. Thanks.
