Steps 2 - 4 have been done.
Mary, since jackie is out tomorrow, you will need to verify the following
Information has flowed across to pops tomorrow morning (check meter catalog).
Meter facility drn
986892 515136 60217
980439 501026 286715
If there is a problem, then you will need to get with romeo.
If everything is okay, you will need to let sherlyn know so she can set up
Accounting arrangements on meter 439 and you will need to enter them into
Pops.

All the days. They are all zero now, however 10/4/2000 and 10/5/2000
Still have a non - zero bav, these should get set to 0 by 10/6. Since
