Mike,
Sorry,
Yes this is still on. I talked to everyone except daren. Just did and he is
Fine with this approach.
Too many plates in the air.
Thanks

Subject: follow up
Bob,
I wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple
Weeks ago. We had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down
With daren and working the off system scheduling.
I was talking with daren last night and he had not heard anything about
This. I plan to begin working with mark and mary next week to learn how to
Schedule these pipes. Before we begin this, I just wanted to make sure that
What we had discussed is still planned.
Thanks for your time.
Mike
