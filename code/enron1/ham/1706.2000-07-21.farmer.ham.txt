I spoke to mr. Maldinado this morning and it doesn' t look good. He claims he
Has a connection to the minister of" energy" who will allocate gas to him. I
Asked where would the gas be delivered, and he said anywhere you want it.
Short term or long term? Again, anything you want, but probably long term is
Better.
I pointed out that there isn' t an energy minister in saudI and would he know
The name of the minister whose giving him the gas? He stumbled and couldn' t
Remember the name.
Finally he said" what do you have to lose? Just send me a letter requesting
Gas with the specs, location and duration" and he' ll do his best to get it.
If you want to try it rob, he' s all yours. His fax number is 562/866 - 7368,
Address 16276 grand avenue, bellflower, ca 90706.

Rob,
I got your name from doug leach. He thought that you would be the person to
Talk to about this.
I got a call last night from rudolph maldonado. (the operator forwarded him
Our way.) he stated that he has some natural gas to sell in saudI arabia.
His number is 562 - 866 - 1755. Could you give him a call and check this out? I
Told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.
I can be reached at 3 - 6905 if you have any questions.
