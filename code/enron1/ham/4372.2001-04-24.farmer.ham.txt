Lee,
Our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid may at the earliest.
This means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to
Fuel. We are nominating the minimum of 80 bbtu/d knowing that we should start
The month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month
Progresses and the cold box comes on line. Call me if you have any questions.
Brian
