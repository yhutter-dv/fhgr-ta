Pat,
This is the texaco fee cp, it flowed a total of 1, 517 from dec 99 to apr 2
2000. There is a strangers agmt. Set up to take allocations, however, this
Must be a wellhead related pt. That has declined. How do I go about finding
Out who this belongs to? I thought about ringing texaco, but, wanted to
Check before I made any calls.
Mary

Stephanie, you are correct. There' s no deal set up for this meter from 12/99
Thru 4/2000.
Mary, please take a look at the meter for the months in question and let
Stephanie or myself know whose gas this belongs to.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks

Anita,
If you are no longer handling this meter, please pass this email on to the
Correct person.
For meter #6563, I have meter statements showing that volume did flow for
12/99 - 4/00 production on this meter. I am not seeing this volume in volume
Management for these production months. For 5/00 and 6/00 production, the
Volumes are there. Is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up?
Please let me know.
Thanks, stephanie (3 - 6004)
