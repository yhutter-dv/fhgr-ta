HI there, darren & tonya,
Merry and doc had their new baby at 9: 26 am yesterday. No name yet. They are
Still trying to settle on one, so in the mean time, i' m just calling him" new
Child" byington.
He weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1/4" long. Merry, doc, and" new child" are
Doing fine. Doc was in there during the whole delivery (c section) so he says
He was a bit shakey there a time or two.
Here are some digital camera pics I took when" n. C." was less thasn an hour
Old.
