I need hpl sales and purchases, back dated to 8/99 between hpl and teco to
Book any processing revenue or losses. Apparently this is in addition to the
Current deal in place and is priced at at different rate. Please let me know
When these tickets are in place so that I can get track id' s and finalize
This issue.
Thank you,
Mary
