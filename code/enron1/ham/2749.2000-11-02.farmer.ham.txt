Subject: texas energy reliability council meeting
Team,
On 15 november, steve and tom s. Will represent hpl at a meeting of the texas
Energy reliability council hosted by commissioner michael williams to discuss
The outlook for gas supply and demand in texas this winter. I will dial in
By phone once I am free from another meeting that morning.
Tom s. Can you find out more detail as to what we need to be ready to
Discuss and then coordinate with the appropriate hpl people to ensure we are
Prepared at the meeting. Specifically, does james or anyone else need to
Attend or be on the call?
Thanks,
Brian
