Lee,
I did my fuel gas estimate and think that we will need 120 - 125 bbtu/day of
Fuel
Gas for the month of april. On a side note, we will bring down our gas
Turbine
Generator on sunday morning. This will bring our high pressure gas
Requirements
Down to essentially zero (it will be zero if our hydrogen plant stays down)
And
The demand will transfer to our low pressure gas. We will be in this
Arrangement for approximately 20 days.
Brian
