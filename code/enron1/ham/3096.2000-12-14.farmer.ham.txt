Victor,
I didn' t know that this was you! I just snapped at the name. What' s up?
Here' s the deal. Enerfin has changed the oba' s effective date again. It now
Is not effective until 12/2000. Clem says that it' s okay but we have to go
Back and change up previous months and have the oba removed and show the
Effective date for 12/2000. Clem is the point person on this.
If need be, come on down and we' ll talk.
Bye
Enron north america corp.

Victor,
What' s your opinion on this? Can we go back and add days to prior month
Deals? Do we use the same price? If we do decide to do this, we will need
To get tetco to agree to do a retro for those days as well.

Subject: 10/2000 - days 6 and 19 (98 - 0439)
The above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to (I guess)
The meter not being turned off in time. The day prior to each of these days
That are assessed to strangers gas, the only active k is the hpl 216.
Can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days?
Thanks
