Daren you are correct in that this was only in mops for the 26 th. It was
Edi' d over to pops from the 25 th through the 31 st populating all days with
The 16, 700 nom. The nom was never - 0 - out in pops therefore the change
Notification process in pops did not pick up a change at this meter. This
Meter is pathed by kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this
Was missed in mops. The record would have been out of balance and someone,
If not several people, normally would make a comment on this. Also - all
Of my records indicate that the 16, 700 was good through the 31 st except the
Mops entry. My confirmations with koch didn' t reflect the - 0 -; the last
Report I have from koch indicated the 16, 700 stayed on, there was no record
Of a phone call indicating anything other than 16, 700. It is very odd for
This many checks and balances to fail. Also, the volumes were being sent
Back to mops which no one caught.
I have spoken with koch today and they agree that the 16, 700 should have gone
To - 0 - therefore I have removed the nom from pops confirmed volumes and
Re - allocated the meter. The oba has taken the hit and I am working off the
Imbalance now.
Daren, I am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my
Responsibility. Stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors
Because I was buried in current activity, thus the e - mail to you asking for
Your help.
If this doesn' t answer all the questions, just give me a call.
Thanks,
Charlotte

Stella and charlotte,
I looked into this deal. We sold this gas for one day only. In mops, the
Path was nominated for 1/26 only. However, in pops the path was nominated
And confirmed for 1/26 - 1/31. This should have been showing up as a
Bridgeback error during the month. Also, someone should have identified that
The path/nom in mops wasn' t the same as the nom in pops. This discrepancy
Should have been found before we closed out january.
I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id
In pops, finding it in mops, and checking the audit on the path in mops).
This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group,
Who has all the necessary tools to find the problem. The resolution, not the
Problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an
Explanation of what happened. Some one still needs to find out how the gas
Was confirmed for the 27 th - 31 st.
Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the
Oba. Unless you can find a missing transport contract.

Joanie,
Logistics is waiting to hear from daren on this issue. He will either need
To extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place. This
Deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are
Looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31. I am sure there is no
Pricing on those days.
I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.
