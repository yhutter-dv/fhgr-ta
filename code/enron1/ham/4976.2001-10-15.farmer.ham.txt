Brian - this relates to an imbalance due enron pre - june 2001. Aep/hpl is negotiating on enron' s behalf to clear these historical imbalances. Lobo wants to pay this gas back on wednesday. You guys can take this in and transport it on hpl to a market (for a fee, of course) or you can outright sell it to hpl after taking receipt at king ranch. It is up to you. I realize that wednesday may be short notice. I was not a party to determining the date of this resolution and have no problem getting these guys to hold off, if need be. Just let me know how you want to proceed. I' m at 832 - 668 - 1181. Thanks.
