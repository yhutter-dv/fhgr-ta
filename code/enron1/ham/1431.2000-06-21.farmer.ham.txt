As most of you have probably heard already, I am leaving enron to pursue some
New endeavors. I will be moving back home to toronto and i' m going to take
Some time off to do some travelling. I plan to go back to school in january,
And after that.... We' ll see what life has in store!
I wanted to thank all of you for the many wonderful experiences I have had
Here at enron. It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know you
All. I hope that if you' re ever in toronto you will drop me a line.
My last day of work will be june 30 th, however, I will be staying in houston
Until the end of july. I hope to see or speak to all of you before I leave,
But if I don' t manage to, please keep in touch. My e - mail address is
Jennifer _ sabine@ yahoo. Com.
Take care and good luck!
Jennifer
