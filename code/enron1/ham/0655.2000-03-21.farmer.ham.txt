I' ll get with brenda on february and brian will be getting me march. Ken
Seaman should have be correct because I personally made him inactive on feb
15 th (the final day of his last pay period... We couldn' t do it his real
Last day because we had to allow that pay period to finish out so it would
Kick out a timesheet for him.) the specialist may actually be amI because
Her title was incorrect for awhile (but we' ll look at it to make sure).
I' ll keep you posted.

Yvette,
Starting with march, all labor distribution reports will come through me, and
I will distribute them. Brenda should have received all of the labor reports
For the rc' s that report to her for february. I say" should have" because
They were supposed to be sent out by someone else. I will try get you a
Copy of the february reports and send them to you.
Hopefully in the future with me controlling the distribution, we will not
Have this problem.
Thanks,
Brian
