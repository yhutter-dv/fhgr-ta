Subject: sap changes
With sap now here there are going to be a few minor changes that we will all
Have to make immediately.
First:
Everyone will have to make internet explorer their default browser. If
You' re not sure how to do this give me a call and I will help. The reason
For this is that our new timesheet program will only run through internet
Explorer.
Second:
Sometime next week we will have a brown bag lunch where I will walk you
Through entering your time in this new system. It' s not time consuming just
Different.
Third:
Next thursday you will be e - mailed an sap log - on id and password. Please
Don' t delete or disregard the importance of this e - mail. You will need it to
Key your time.
Fourth:
All company and rc #' s are changing. The company part is easy. It will be 4
Digits so if your company number is currently 413 it will now be 0413 or if
It is 012 it will now be 0012. Easy. Rc #' s are now called cost centers and
They are changing completely. Please write these down somewhere you will
Need them just like you need to know your rc.
Rc 1497 = cc 105633
Rc 1638 = cc 105634
Rc 2664 = cc 105630
Rc 2933 = cc 106292
Rc 0688 = cc 105631
Rc 1160 = cc 105632
Rc 2675 = cc 105638
Rc 2939 = cc 106269
Rc 2940 = cc 106290
Rc 2663 = cc 105629
The transition shouldn' t be too painful for you but it promises to be a
Little stressful for your assistants so please bear with us and cooperate.
Thank you!
