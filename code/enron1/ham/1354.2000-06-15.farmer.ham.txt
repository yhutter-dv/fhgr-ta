I received a call from carl drachenberg with hms at approximately 1: 45 pm on
6/13/00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter #986315 and it was wet and
Flowing at 35 lb. I asked gary hanks what we want to do and he said to have
Carl notify the producer and shut it in. I notified carl and he got in
Touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx. 2 pm on
6/13 and at that time there wasn' t any flow. Carl came back out there at 8
Am on 6/14 and closed the valve and removed the chart. There was no flow
After they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf.
The meter is now out of service.
Any questions - you know where to find me.
