February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for hpl and chan. Hpl should have 3, 600 dth and chan should
Have 11, 500 dth on the interconnect.

On the matagorda 624, but according to epgt, they delivered 10, 362 dth to hpl (?) could this possibly
Need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?
