Subject: koch midstream services
Fyi, I was watching the position manager for ena and noticed some business
Transactions on this pipeline. This pipeline was bought by duke energy field
Services effective 8/1/99. All hplc transactions were moved to that pipe at
That time. The ces transactions that are current on this pipe should be
Moved to duke energy field services. I believe the pipe was renamed when
They bought it back in june or july.
If you have any questions, or want to verify this information, I would check
With the global contracts dept.
