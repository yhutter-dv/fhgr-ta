Subject: change name on pipeline, contract no. Teco 9121, global contract no.

Please be advised that contract no. Teco 9121 shows in the global contract
System as pg & e texas pipeline, l. P., however, the pipeline name should be
Pg & e gas transmission teco, inc.. Apparently, the pipeline name was entered
Into the global system incorrectly. I have confirmed this with charles berner
In the contracts administration section and kim watson, both with pg & e gas
Transmission teco, inc.. The contract name should be pg & e gas transmission
Teco, inc.
I would like to change the pipeline to reflect the correct pipeline name
Effective april 1, 2000. Thus it will not affect the previous noms for this
Contract.
All please respond to let me know if this will cause problems with
Replication or anything else with the system.
Julie and stacey, deal no. 47434 is attached to this contract you may need
To change this in your system.
