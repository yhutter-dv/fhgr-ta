Subject: pathing question
Daren,
I have hpl resources meter 988055 wasn' t sure if I should path this for april 3 rd' s deal change.
And I have mobil oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30, 000 that change to 50, 000 for the 3 rd.
I didn' t path them since they are industrials and aimee' s notes told me to path industrials -
Except for a few exceptions.
Thanks, julie
