Subject: urgent
Ed has requested that we compile a list this morning of all parties/points
Which we owe gas to, in the event that we need to find a home for excess
Volumes today. Please email me a list of any meters/contracts that you are
Aware of. I am compiling an interim list based upon the rtu variance report
For march, however, I don' t want to rely on this list as you may be engaged
In balancing at meters with variances.
Thank you,
Mary
