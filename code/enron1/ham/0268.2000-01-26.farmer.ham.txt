Subject: deals 141877, 141883, and 141884 (koch midstream) were in ces' s system (and
Ours) as term sales. However, those deals were terminated by ces. So, any
Volumes at kmid are sold to midcon texas p/l operator at if -. 09. The purchase
Price is (. 10) for base volumes and (. 11) for swing volumes. For feb, i
Zeroed the volumes in deals 141877, 141833, 141884, in sitara. All of the
Volumes will be in deal 156256. O' neal, do we need to risk assign this new
