Subject: meter 5892 south katy gas unit 2 - allocation
Daren - - -
I need some help with meter 5892 for september 00 due to a feedback error.
Deal 133196 (purchase from duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due to
It' s expiration date of 8/31/00...... However it still showed up in pops (w/o
A nom) on 9/1. Volume management allocated volume to it according to the
Allocation statement. Should this deal be extended? I noticed it is not out
There for october either. I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if
You want to see them.
Let me know,
Mark

P. S. Fred boas said you used to handle this and you were very wise in the art
Of allocation...... So I am expecting big results grasshopper!
