Subject: sitara eol bridge problem today
The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate. Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (the bridge takes 2 minute for startup). Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the sitarar eolbridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.
The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.
