Just to clarify, its not the relative age of the production date, but the age
Of the event itself.

Scotty/richard,
Our dbas would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in
Contract _ event _ status. We have over 1 gig of data in that table. I would
Like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any
Row with a last _ mod _ date over a month (or two) old. So if someone balances
February 1999 this month, we will keep it around for a month (or two).
Does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter/longer period
Of time?
This is not an audit table. This is just a" log" every nom/track/balance/edi
Send/fax send/sched qty/quick response since the beginning of time.
