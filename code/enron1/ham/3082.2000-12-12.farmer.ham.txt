Subject: succession plan
It is my great pleasure to announce that the board has accepted my
Recommendation to appoint jeff skilling as chief executive officer, effective
At the time of their next board meeting on february 12, 2001. Jeff will also
Retain his duties as president and chief operating officer. I will continue
As chairman of the board and will remain at enron, working with jeff on the
Strategic direction of the company and our day - to - day global operations.
Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all
Cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth. He is clearly ready for
The job, and after 15 years as ceo of this great company, I , m ready for a
Somewhat different role.
Our succession plan has been clear for some time. This has afforded jeff and
Me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that
Continues to exceed everyone , s expectations, including our own. We look
Forward to furthering that relationship as jeff expands his role.
There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad
Shifts in strategy and direction.
Please join me in congratulating jeff. I look forward to a great 2001.
