Megan: all price changes regarding ces texas should be filtered through me
And/or the texas economics desk (bryan hull or o' neal winfree).
O' neal/bryan: can we look into these co - owner deals to ensure accurate
Pricing and risk assignment?
Thanks,
Ami

I think the price needs to be changed on deal 141977 for ces - hunt petroleum.
It should be hsc - 0. 10. I need this asap.
Thanks,
