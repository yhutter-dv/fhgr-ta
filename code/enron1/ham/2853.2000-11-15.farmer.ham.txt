Subject: meter 6315, purch from torch/rally, october
Daren,
I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on
The first two days. However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we
Have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few
Days in the middle. Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85%
Of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on strangers until we determine
What to do. I am now on the dreaded ua 4 list from vol. Mgmt.
Mary
