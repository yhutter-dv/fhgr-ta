Anita,
Per our meeting yesterday, I have set up the necessary usage tickets. I
Could not set up just one b/c they can only be set up for approx. 3 months at
A time. Therefore, I had to set up 7 usage tickets which are listed below:
02/99 to 04/99 sitara deal 396904
05/99 to 07/99 sitara deal 396925
08/99 to 10/99 sitara deal 396942
11/99 to 12/99 sitara deal 396951
01/00 to 03/00 sitara deal 396956
04/00 to 06/00 sitara deal 396964
07/00 to 09/00 sitara deal 396680
For 9/00 I will go back and repath it for the lst through 12 th so it should
Be correct when you allocate it. Let me know when you have the track ids for
The other months. Thanks.
