FyI - - - I changed points on this deal from pgtt - teco waha 18002800 to pgtt - teco
Katy 20606100 for the 2 nd. Let me know if you don' t agree with this. The
Supply, duke field svs, was originally trying to deliver to hpl at midtex,
This deal #589257 was also changed to meter 20606100.
Thanks,
Mark
