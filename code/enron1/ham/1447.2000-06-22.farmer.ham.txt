Per mary, sitara can not handle it either. It can calculate and withhold
Volume from the deal as a% for fuel, but not as part of the price. Steve
Says this is a nightmare for the denver office. Can you take the" to do" to
Follow - up on this throughout the systems, and get back with ed to further
Discuss? I' d really appreciate it.

Subject: re: fuel
We need to discuss further. My concern would be that how do we know what%
Hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
Fuel cost? Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance? I think
That pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
Retainage. But, if we retain fuel on ena transports, then we need to come up
With a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline.
Currently, this process is not in place.

Brenda,
As you know fuel is a big risk. One of the things we are trying to do is get
The shipper to pay fuel. This would mean we would purchase, transport and
Possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price. Can the
Downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?
