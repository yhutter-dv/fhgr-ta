Subject: nomination - tuesday, 4/11
This is to nominate 27, 800 mmbtu/d for 4/11 into eastrans.
20, 000 mmbtu/d will be redelivered into pg & e, the rest into
Hpl from fuels cotton valley.
We plan to begin receiving the gas at 3: 00 pm or so and take
More volume to average the nominated quantity for the day.
As I indicated on the phone, it will also be necessary to
Deliver more into pg & e after flow starts to average
Nominated quantity.
Thanks.
