Subject: tenaska iv feb 2001
We do not have a demand fee for the feb 2001 tenaska iv sale, deal 384258.
Can you please put this in so I can bill? From your spreadsheet, it looks
Like it needs to be $2, 291, 888. 83, but you can verify. I subtracted the
Agency fee from the tenaska iv receipt number, since we already have that
Booked.
