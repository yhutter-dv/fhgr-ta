Subject: desk to desk ticket between nng and pgev and oplc
Daren has copied the old ticket and reput the volumes on a new deal ticket, dating back to the first, which reflects the correct texas desk entity. All of the buys/sales currently transacted at waha by the texas desk are done by hplc - hplc. Please check your deal tickets as any volumes for april will need to be repathed, nom' d, etc.
Thank you,
Mary
