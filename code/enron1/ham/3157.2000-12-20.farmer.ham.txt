Subject: update on union carbide safety net gas
Got a call last night from carbide - they rescinded the change from 14, 000/d
Rate to 6, 000/d rate for safety net gas that was due 9 am this morning.
So here' s where we should be now with carbide:
Seadrift - no saftey net, just the 10, 000/d baseload deal
Texas city - 10, 000/d of the term deal, plus 14, 000/d of safety net, total
24, 000/d
Call with questions
