Meter 098 - 4179, goliad co., tx
In regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what I have been
Able to determine from the information available to me.
To your questions:
1. Cannot determine who owns this meter. I will contact molly carriere on
Monday when she returns.
2. Hpl has a fifty (50) ft. Easement at this location which does contain
Language for appurtenance rights within the 50'.
3. I pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
Project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so I am assuming
One was not located.
Hope this helps.

Debbie,
Meter 098 - 4179 is located at sta. Plus 40 + 85 on align. Dwg. Hc - 1130 - 18 - h in
Goliad co., tx. In connection with the facility agreement request below, we
Need to know the following:
1. Who owns the meter, hplc or the operator?
2. Do we own an easement and an access right of way to the meter station?
3. Is there, to your knowledge, a facility agreement in place covering this
Meter? We cannot locate such an agreement in our records.

Shawna,
Attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
Coastal oil the
Legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
Consent to assign document to reflect this transaction.
We have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
Previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists.
The facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
To be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
Valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht #4 well.
Once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht #4 well is ready to
Flow, we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht #4 well only
Via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc. The albrecht #4 will not be
Covered by 96008903, nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
Subject to the spot gtc.
Coastal will reimburse hplc $39, 600 for the cost of the installation.

Lal,
We intend to attempt to connect about 4, 000 mmbtu/d of new production from
The newly drilled coastal oil in may, 2000, the meter flowed about 960
Mmbtu/d of 3. 36% co 2 gas.
The content of the albrecht #4 gas according to the field gas analysis
Prepared by coastal oil the albrecht #4 h 2 s content
Is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu/d behind
Meter 098 - 4179, the miller - albrecht unit #1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
#1 a & #2 d. Coastal further purports that for some time now it (and/or its
Predecessor, mjg, corp.) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
Sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
Levels. Coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
Content of the albrecht #4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
Hplc. In your opinion, should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
For this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc?
