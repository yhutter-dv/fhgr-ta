I can not believe you are sending emails form hawaii!!!! You are crazy. I
Took care of camden for the month -
It is now 330 and hilcorp has not responded. I spoke with jerry bubert
Several times today - emailed mike lannou and left messages, and had him
Paged, and copied hildebrand (the president). If we don' t hear by 4 pm, we
Are supposed to bypass the gas...........
