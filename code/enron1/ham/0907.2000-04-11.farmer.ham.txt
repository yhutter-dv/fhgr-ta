Who is considered to be on greg sharp' s orig team? If they have deals in the
Wellhead portfolio, do we need to move them out? Just double checking.

Great. Keep in mind - some people continue to confuse" wellhead portfolio"
With" deals done by producer services." all that should be in the wellhead
Portfolio is truly wellhead deals - not deals done by greg sharp' s
Origination teams at competitive points. Does that make sense?

I worked with tom acton last night to get the wellhead portfolio cleaned up.
Tom had a sheet from vance that we used to determine what deals should be in
The portfolio. I believe the portfolio is now correct. The sitara team will
Move the deals we identified today.
