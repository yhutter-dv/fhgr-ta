Aimee,
Are you confirming these volumes with hl & p? We have been doing some special
Deals at green' s bayou and the hl & p dealmaker has been calling to find out
What the volumes are. I do not think he communicates with his scheduler, is
That the case? Anyway, we need to agree with hl & p on what volumes flowed on
These special days and get them into the system so they can be billed
Correctly.
