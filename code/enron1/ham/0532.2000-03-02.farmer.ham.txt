Subject: feb 2000 intercompany accrual variances
Below is a list of sitara deals that had volume variances or where one side
(purchase/sale) did not get accrued for the feb 2000 accrual. My goal
Here is to bring this to everyone attention and second to see if there is a
Solution. I am taking a simplistic approach here in that since
Intercompany sitara deals are the same that the nominations on both sides
Should match on the month end accruals. If I am wrong on this assumption
Or if there is a system limitation I am free to suggestions, ideas or
Resolutions. Please feel free to give me a call.

Mission: proactively identify and resolve intercompany volume issues
Upstream.
First goal: tying intercompany volumes on the monthly accruals.
Second goal: tying intercompany volumes on actuals.
Third goal: minimizing analyse time saving $$$$.
