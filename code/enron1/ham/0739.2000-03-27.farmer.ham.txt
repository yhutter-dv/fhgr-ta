Gary, mainline valves to be closed on the 18" 3026 line are as follows:
U - 5 at crown street and u - 6 at the end of the line where ship channel loop
3026 line ties into the shell west 4792 line.
It is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
Section currently take gas:
Air products meter 1418
Albemarle meter 1188
The current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4/13/00 and be back
In service on 4/16/00.

Which mainline valves will be closed during the work and can you send me a
List of the meters in the affected section? I need to get with the texas
Desk prior to their pre - bid meeting which is this friday, march 24.
Based on the changes, it still appears to me the work is planned for the last
Week in april. As a date becomes firm please let me know.
Thanks
Gary

The pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised.
Actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max. This outage time, which is longer than the norm, is due to the
Fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
Ditch before tie ins take place.
As an update, the first train is now scheduled to cross late today. They now
Say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
Able to begin replacing our line.

I have been advised by the deer park rr representative, dean truitt, that
The rail cars will begin arriving on 3/15/00.
Per our conversations today, please have someone on tuesday 3/13 adjust the
Regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that 280 psig is the maximum
Pressure in that pipeline section.
I will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
Keep you informed. It is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
Will be on the order of 2 weeks.
After the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility, deer
Park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
Replacement at that location. This replacement would involve an outage on
This segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days. I would anticipate that
This outage would occur in early april.
Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.
