Subject: re: industrial report
I am completing the last of 3 - worksheets {1 - julie m. & 2 - ken s.} today and
Will distribute them once I finish.
Sorry for the delay but various office julie meyers file or ken
Seaman file?
Both files provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support
Groups.
To prepare both files I feel is a duplicate of my efforts. Please let
Know if you want both files updated
And the approximate time table for completion.
