Linda -
I did not know that this was part of a natural gas/crude oil exchange deal
And billed texas general land office for the gas sale in jan. 01
Do you have a crude oil payable to offset this sales invoice?
If so, will this a/r balance of $974, 144. 00 be netted against the crude oil
Payable in sap?
Please let me know, I would like to take care of the net in sap asap.
Thanks - katherine
