The pricing for the base deal is based on the gd, but it' s the average of the gas daily plus. 02, right? And I was told that sitara could not handle this pricing structure, that it had to be calculated and entered as a fixed price. Is this correct?

Valerie,
The pricing on the base deal should also be based on gd. I have changed the price to gdp. Let me know if that doesn' t correct that piece. Jay is currently looking into the volume issue.

Jay,
For june, I need a couple of things changed in sitara:
Deal 819592 - the commodity price needs to be 3. 6318
Deal 819594 - the commodity price needs to be waha. Hub. Gdp. D. A +. 02
And for july............
It looks like we' re missing some volume............
Deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55, 000 per day allocated. And in sitara this deal should be priced at $3. 0505.
Deal 895691 - swing deal - currently has 234, 000 in the scheduled column and it should be 441, 000 based on the spreadsheet I sent. Did you have some conflicting volumes? I' m resending what the volumes should be. And the pricing for this should be at waha. Hub. Gdp. D. A +. 02.

I think that should do if for now. I' ll wait to see how these changes come across. Please notify me when these changes have been made. Thanks!

Valerie,
In reference to a note sent to darren farmer: houston pipleline mistake on june 18 th
The volume of 50, 000 for deal 819594 was a mistake. The proper value was 30, 000 just as you had mentioned. Everything should now be fixed. Please let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks,
Jay smith
