Subject: re: ces - devon
Rita,
Since this is the case, I think we need to change the way we are booking this
Deal. Currently, the ces - devon purchase is on 8348, which is a dummy inlet
To the plant. Rather, we should probably just have the ena purch at the
Tailgate, 986363, with a d 2 d ticket that transfers ownership to hpl, if
Necessary. Please let me know what you think.
