Subject: final cp name change and merger report 08/00
Just to clarify, I was in the february 2000 report in error when I sent the
Report out to everyone. Please notice at the bottom of the report that there
Is a worksheet tab for august 2000 and that is where the current information
Is located. I apologize for the confusion.
Also, the erms shortname changes will be made this afternoon 8/24.
