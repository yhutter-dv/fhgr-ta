Subject: follow up
Bob,
I wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple weeks ago. We had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down with daren and working the off system scheduling.
I was talking with daren last night and he had not heard anything about this. I plan to begin working with mark and mary next week to learn how to schedule these pipes. Before we begin this, I just wanted to make sure that what we had discussed is still planned.
Thanks for your time.
Mike
