Subject: aspect resources - meter #78033, #78032 - 3/00 production
Daren,
I' m not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me. If you
Are not, could you please let me know who I need to speak to.
For meter #78033 and #78032 for 3/00 production forward, this deal is set
Up under the wrong sitara #, therefore the volumes are not pulling in sitara.
The sitara #that it is currently attached to is #149421 which this deal
Was only for 1/00 production. The new sitara number that we should be using
Is
Sitara #156387 (for meter #78033) and sitara #156383 (for meter #78032
). I have attached an example to help see what I am talking about.
(this was for 2/00 production)
Could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is
Something that I need to do.
Thanks, stephanie (3 - 6004)
