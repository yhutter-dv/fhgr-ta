Please schedule a meeting with me to review the enhancements lising - the
Prioritizations and status. I am interested in understanding the listing of
Enhancements, the benefits of the enhancements, what is required of both user
And it resources to complete the enhancements, who the resources are and the
Status of completion. It should cover all systems - sitara, unify (mops,
Volume management and settlements) and pops. Please include anyone else
(management team, it, etc.) who is necessary to ensure thorough explanations.
