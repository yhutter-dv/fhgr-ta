Jeff,
Here are more deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books as a result of our contracts auto - terminating. I hope to finish the list of auto - terminated deals today (if no emergencies arise that pull me off this).
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks for being so patient.
