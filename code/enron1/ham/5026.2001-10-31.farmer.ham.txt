Subject: hplc - four square 5/01
Darren:
I have another hplc issue... I received an invoice from four square gas company today for may 2001 gas that was never paid. They have invoiced 1, 654 at 4. 825 (hsc -. 085) at meter 986887. I did not see a deal in unify, so I went to pops to find the meter. I found that the gas was pathed to the strangers gas contract. Historically, hplc has always purchased the gas at this meter from four square, but it doesn' t look like a deal was ever entered for may. The april deal number was 695469. Did hplc purchase this gas in may?
