Subject: missing txu lonestar and oasis paths
Stacey,
It looks like your missing paths revealed a quirk in our suppression of zero
Paths. There were 4 paths initially entered as zero, then changed to
Non - zero on a later date. The system did not correctly determine that the
Zero path should no longer be suppressed.
We have fixed the 4 paths affected and have corrected the code so this won' t
Happen any more. Below is a screen print of the nov 22 problem that is now
Fixed.
Thanks, d. N.
