Subject: 987012
Daren, I just talked to mary and she said that they developed the meter
987341 for the meters that you had nominated under the 987012. Under
Aggregate 7012 is 4045; 6026; 6114; 6427; 6848; 9755; these should all be
Under the 987341. Do we need to renominate these meters or do I just move
Them in pops. Let me know daren I aim to please (I think that' s a southern
Term!!)
