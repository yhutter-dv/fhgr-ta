Subject: performance review - mid - year
For those of you who have been trying to access the pep system, this morning
Or today, stop trying. There are still problems with the system and it is
Unlikely that you will be bale to get in or submit your reviewers
Successfully.
Instead, please submit your list of reviewers to brenda via e - mail. She will
Make any changes necessary and forward them on to the pep helpdesk. They
Will then be responsible for entering your reviewers manually.
If you have any questions, please call.
Thanx!

Subject: performance review - mid - year
It' s that time of the year again - just earlier this year than last year!!!
Please log into the pep system, when it becomes available, and select at
Least five feedback reviewers. The feedback is intended to reflect
Interraction throughout the organization. For leads and managers and
Directors, please make sure you include at least one direct report. The
Reviewers you select should be employees whom you have worked with frequently
Since 1/1/00 and whom can provide constructive feedback as to your
Performance. Nothing prevents you from selecting more than 5 reviewers. I
Will review them, and if I feel there are others whom should be added, I will
Do so. Assuming the system becomes available soon, please complete your
Selection process by cob, tuesday, 5/16/00. I want to approve these asap, so
We can get our request out early. Turn around is critical.
The next thing I will need is a listing of your accomplishments for 2000. I
Would like these by e - mail by monday, june 5, 10: 00 am. Once again, the
Timeline is critical to the process, and is not negotiable.
Although we have reorganized the risk group effective 5/1/00, I will still
Perform the performance reviews. Mike, steve will be responsible for your
Review.
Let me know if you hav any questions or concerns. Thanks for supporting the
Process and the timeline!
