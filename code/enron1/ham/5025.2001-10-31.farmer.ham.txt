As I mentioned to you yesterday, it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to tx glo do not have linda robert' s origination fee deducted. Do we need to execute a pma with txglo to deduct those volumes from the next delievery?
Also isn' t there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $cost of gas for the gas delivered to txglo? Is that being captured in unify or is it being manually entered by gas accounting?

Do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct?

Eric:
I reviewed the gas deals on franks' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in sitara. As soon as I have the october gas numbers, I will forward them to you.
Attached is a spreadsheet of the tglo deals booked to the gl to help you with our current settlement position. It is divided by debit/credit entries. When the sales are booked, a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account (40004000 third party; 40005000 intercompany) for the profit center.
Below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to egm. I have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book aug and sept crude. I will wait for the go ahead from frank before I final them to the gl. Let me know if you have any questions.
