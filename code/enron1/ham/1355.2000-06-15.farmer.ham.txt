Texas has a 42% increase year to year, a 22% increase qtr. To qtr. And a 30%
Increase mo. To mo. The yr. To yr. And qtr to qtr increases can be explained
By an increase in eol transactions and entex taking more gas. The mo. To mo.
Increase is attributable to increase eol transactions and tufco taking more
Gas.

Subject: wholesale volumes
It' s that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!
The database for may is now ready for viewing. Just as a reminder, this is
The shortcut on your desktop called" statistical database".
As there is continued investor focus on our wholesale operations, investor
Relations requests that business analysis & reporting provide monthly
Volumetric analysis for wholesale operations in addition to the quarterly
Analysis. Please review the analysis for may 2000 and provide explanations
For all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year, quarter/quarter, and
Month/month variances. The current objective of investor relations is to use
This analysis as a resource to answer potential investor or analyst
Questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and presentations. It is
Essential that the volumes be verified by commercial personnel.
Please forward your verification and explanations via e - mail to me by 10: 00 am
On monday, june 19. Please feel free to call with any questions.
Thanks,
MistI day
