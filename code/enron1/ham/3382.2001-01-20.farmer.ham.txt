Subject: neon discussion january 24
Here is an idea for this week.? Next week brad cox is planning on starting a
Discussion series based on the experiencing god study, that he will modify
For teenagers to be used in neon.? It will probably consist mainly of
Questions similar to what you' re getting this week.? At this point in the
Semester your kids hopefully feel comfortable with each other to go ahead
And spring right into some biblically relevant discussions.? Make sure,
Though, that you do what is necessary for your kids to connect with each
Other and with you as adults and to make visitors feel at ease.? Spend time
Visiting together as a group, and then individually with the kids after neon
Is officially over with cokes and cookies.? Remember that that the" before
And after" is probably the most important aspect of neon.
