Thanks, bob. It now turns out that due to operational issues, the additional 10, 000/d may not come on next week. Spinnaker is having problems dealing with all the condensate associated with this gas and may not have the proper equipment in place to allow the additional gas to flow and also handle the additional condensate associated with that gas. I' ll keep you posted.

George,
The texas general land office transport volume is in pops for may nominated at 4, 800/d. Deal #535132 was initially set up as a wellhead purchase from texas general land office. The transport volume of 4, 800/d comprises approximately 22% of the total volume nominated at the meter.

Bob, we currently have a total of 16. 817 mmbtu/d nominated for purchases at meter 098 - 9862 as follows:
Spinnaker exploration company, l. L. C sit 379424 5, 886/d 27%
Ranger oil company sit 533410 5, 886/d 27%
The houston exploration company sit 535119 5, 045/d 23%
It appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132, which shows 0 as the expectted volume. Texas glo has historically transported about 23% of the gas at the n. Padre is. Block 883 l.
Once it starts flowing, the incremental 10, 000 mmbtu/d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above.
