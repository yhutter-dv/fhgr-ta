Attached per your request is the big cowboy production for october 2000. I
Also have the gas volume statements from coral energy that shows the actual
Daily volumes for all of the meters, receipt and delivery, if you need that
Level of detail.
If there is anything else let me know either today or tomorrow because I will
Be on vacation next week.
