Daren - - - (re: the email below from kathy benedict) if i' m not mistaken, i
Thought we didnt take end up taking over cornhusker completely until
October? I thought tenaska was still doing it, at least accounting for it.
Therefore, this gas wasn' t pathed during the month... And I believe we didnt
Have all the tickets in at the time. What do you recall?
Thanks,
