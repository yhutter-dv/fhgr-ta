Subject: tenaska iv transport 10/00
I took a look at the transport for txu lone star for tenaska iv for 10/00.
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added. Let me
Know if you need copies of the invoices. The meters below are delivery
Meters. I wasn' t sure what the receipt meters would be.
Deal 452491, meter 20014903 need to add days 24 - 26 and 28 - 31
Need to check rate - we show $0. 01 and we were billed $0. 02
Deal 452491, meter 25000200 need to check rate - we show $0. 02 and we were
Billed $0. 10
Deal 452475, meter 25000200 need to check rate - we show prices from $0. 005
To $0. 02
And we were billed $0. 11
Thanks,
