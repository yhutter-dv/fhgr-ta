Daren,
Do you have any information on these deals? We cannot collect the cash from
Midcon if we can' t prove to them the
Deals are valid.
Thanks,
Kris

Pat dresner (accountant) at midcon texas says she does not show these deals
In her system and she can not pay on them. You created the deals in sitara
And I don' t have another trader' s name. Could you please talk to your kn
Trader regarding this situation? If midcon really got this gas, then someone
At kn should tell their accountant about the deal.
