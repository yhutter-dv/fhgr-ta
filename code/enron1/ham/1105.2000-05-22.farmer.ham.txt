This issue still has not been resolved, and it is effecting the pg & e
Contract 5095 - 037, hplc transport contract ta 99 - 027, several deals on the
Interconnect report, and causing payment issues for katherine herrera to
Panenergy marketing. I have sent several emails, faxed the daily' s and left
Voice messages, but have not received any updates to this issue.

I am looking into this with lorraine to figure this out. We did not nominate
This for the days you are referring to, but lorraine says she flowed this gas
Even though I cut the volume. I will let you know when this is resolved.
Thanks.
