Subject: july activity driver survey
We are in the midst of enhancing the operations pricing model (fka
Transaction costing model) and as a result the following applies:
- do not need the hours surveys completed for july or august
- need the activity driver surveys completed for july and august
Attached is the activity driver survey for the month of july. Please fill
Out the attached activity driver survey with july numbers for your rc and
Return to sharI mao by end of day friday, august 11.
During the enhancment period (july and august) we will be standardizing and
Consolidating activities across all commodities and operational functions.
This will result in a shorter survey and easier time assignment to activities
For your teams. The shorter and easier surveying process will begin with the
September survey.
Please call either me or sharI mao at 39641 or 33859, respectively for any
Clarification. Thanks for your patience and help,
