Daren:
During the period of 12/1/99 through 3/31/00 gas flowed into hpl' s pipeline
At the above meter. The gas volumes that flowed are as follows:
12/1/99 - 12/31/99 1, 457 mmbtus
01/1/00 - 01/31/00 49 mmbtus
02/1/00 - 02/29/00 7 mmbtus
03/1/00 - 03/31/00 4 mmbtus
1, 517 mmbtus
Prior to 12/1/99, the volumes were being purchased from high sierra operating
Llc under contract #96003435 deal #26611 which have terminated. Currently,
Logistics has these volumes recorded to hpl stranger gas contract. In order
To correct this, hpl logistics needs either a new deal to record these
Volumes which have flowed into hpl' s pipeline, or logistics needs approval to
Write - off these volumes to unaccounted for gas loss. (please print, sign,
And return the original to clem cernosek).
Deal/deal ticket #/ customer (buyer/seller)
Or
Approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
Thanks, clem
