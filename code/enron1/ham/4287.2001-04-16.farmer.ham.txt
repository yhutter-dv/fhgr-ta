Subject: southern union - 03/01 prod - austin spot deal #690249 (sale)
Janet -
Per southern union' s confirmation sheet, the 15, 000 mmbtus spot deal on days 03/25 & 3/26 should be priced at hsc gdp da +. 05 (at tuesday, 3/27/01 pricing - which was $5. 235). Currently, sitara is showing a price of hsc gdp +. 05.
Is this tuesday pricing correct? If so, pls forward this to daren so that he can change the price in sitara to $5. 235 +. 05 (totaling $5. 285).
Thanks - katherine
