Robert:
I have updated the info at enron methanol per gas control' s volumes (via
Meter overrides). I did not realize that' s what you wanted when you handed
Me the" sticky" on monday..... I thought you were just being informative.
Sorry about the confusion.

This is a follow up to the note I gave you on monday, 4/3/00 {preliminary
Flow data provided by daren}.
Please override pop' s daily volume {presently zero} to reflect daily
Activity you can obtain from gas control.
This change is needed asap for economics purposes.
