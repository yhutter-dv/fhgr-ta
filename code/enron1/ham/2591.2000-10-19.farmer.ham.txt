I have an exit interview scheduled for 2 pm on fri. Is there any way we can
Make the interview a little later in the afternoon, so I can have most of the
Afternoon to train my replacement.
Thanks,
Ami

AmI has decided to resign from her present position. Her reason is that she
Wants a change in atmosphere/scenery. She has decided to pick up and move to
San francisco. She does not a job lined up and tom martin has agreed to let
Her stay until friday, october 20.
Hector, let me and amI know more about the time/location of the exit
Interviews. Also, if there is something else you need from me in this
Process, please let me know.
