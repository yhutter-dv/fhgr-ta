I have a correction:
I changed the pipe code but the system will not allow me to save because the meter no. For pgtt 4100101 already exist on facility no. 517817.
Karl please contact me as soon as possible to discuss this matter.

Look thru the sequence history. The meter #on the opposite side did not change
Even though the pipe code did. That is all I have to suggest.

I need to get the approval from daren farmer ext. 3 - 6905. Please feel
Free to contact him to discuss this matter.
Also, I do not believe the meter no. Will be the same. I searched pi
Grid and it shows hpl with drn 92686 interconnect with meter no.
237 - 07 - 1 - 004, drn 26879 for teco pipeline co.
We have discrepencies/isssues.
What verifying information do you have for this meter?
