Have you had a chance to change the pricing in the system?
Duke has called me several times they want to get our march deals finalized.
I am not sure what I should tell them.

Deal #157288
Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. Separate the centena term deal
From the spot deal in sitara for march 2000 production.
Also, I need to have the price for the east texas redelivery changed in
Sitara from hs index $-. 085 to hs index $-. 0825. This is per the contract
The price for this redelivery point.
Thanks
Katherine
