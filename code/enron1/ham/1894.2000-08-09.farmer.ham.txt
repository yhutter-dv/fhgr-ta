Kellie,
Pg & e will probably try to bill us for parking a volume of 10, 263 for august 8
And 9 at $. 03/mmbtu each day. Please do not pay this charge when we receive
This invoice. Pg & e was unable to make deliveries into el paso because of
High sulfur content in their gas and is trying to charge us with a parking
Charge for gas that they could not deliver. Please let me know if you need
Any additional information. Thanks.
