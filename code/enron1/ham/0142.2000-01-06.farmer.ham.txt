FyI - we will probably be asked what historical information is needed in our
Shop from a logistics perspective. I would suggest asking the new ces
Employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal
With historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as
Well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer
And asset transactions.
Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to
The it folks.
Thanks - bob

The following summarizes the decisions made during our user & it joint
Meeting today regarding the handling of ces historical data.
A. Bryce baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify ces reports
That need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that
Will be accessed via the electronic document management system.
B. Jeff peoples will be working with bryce baxter to produce reports using
Ces system via isdn line at enron building - this will continue to be part of
His duty until the job is done (jeff joined ena as a member of sitara group).
C. Larry daze will be working with jeff peoples and bryce baxter to ensure
All reports are loaded on our edms with proper indexing.
D. No need for manupulating ces history data is necessary (i. E. Downloading
On spreadsheets). Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than
Edms.
