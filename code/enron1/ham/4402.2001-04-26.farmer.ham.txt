Bob,
I' m still concern about april' s nom; if we don' t take it to zero, than we could have the possibility of the allocations group adding volumes to barrett' s april deal. This would be incorrect.

Bob,
Hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april. As for as barrett, they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca; therefore, 100% of barrett' s production is being paid to seneca. Consequently, you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties.
Let me know is you can' t.

Are we still purchasing gas at meter 435 from barrett resources, ocean energy and seneca resources? They were on george' s spreadsheet but they are not termed up. The only deals termed up are mariner, st. Mary land, walter oil & gas and the meridian resource.
