FyI -
It apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12/99 -
04/02/00, were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase.
Therefore, vance explained to me that the volume of 1, 517 dth for the period
Should have been allocated to the strangers agreement, just as it was. Any
Deliveries were unauthorized (udog) and the gas then belongs to hpl. Please
Give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue.
Thank you all for your patience and assistance. I appreciate it!
