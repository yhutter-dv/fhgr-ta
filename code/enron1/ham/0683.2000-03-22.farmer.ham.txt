As you are aware, we broke a shaft in the mug compressor on the methanol
Unit at clear lake on saturday march 11 th. We originally anticipated a two
Week outage for repairs. Unfortunately, due to delays in the delivery of a
Coupling needed to finish repairs, we have extended the downtime for
Another week. We hope to be up april 2 nd or 3 rd if all goes well.
