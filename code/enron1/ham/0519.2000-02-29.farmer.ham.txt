One more request....
The ken petroleum contract: 96019316 will terminate tonight (2/29/00)! I
Believe that also means that the deal attached to this contract will
Terminate. It covers meter 6834.
Tom, can you put in the following one month ticket:
Counterparty meter volumes price
Ken petroleum corporation 6834 89 mmbtu if/hsc less $0. 41
Julie, can you confirm via a gtc spot, per george' s request.
Thank you for handling on such short notice.
