Subject: re: killing ena to ena deals in sitara
Jay,
If a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in unify if there are any paths associated with the deal; therefore, we request the deals be zeroed out. Call me if this is a problem. Also, we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed.
In addition, I have copied rita and mark from volume management for their input.
Regards,
Tammy

Richars/tammy:
We will be killing about 2000 deals in sitara tonight. Whenever a deal is touched in sitara, it will bridge over to unify. These are desk 2 desk deals, and should have minimal impact on you.
