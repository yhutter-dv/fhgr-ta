And get back to me on the following items:
Person to send the letters to at the respective companies

Name and adress of ena person to direct inquiries to
Name and phone number of person to direct questions re: the notification
Letter
People at tenaska to copy and their address and fax #' s
Comments on substance of the letter (please review carefully my reference to
What ena is acting as agent for - - it is specific as to noms, scheduling and
Billing, not a general agency for all things under the contract - - is that
Correct?)
If you don' t mind, please forward any email response to bob walker and leave
Me a voicemail. I will be out of the office friday, but checking voicemail
And coordianting with bob to get these out.
Also, once we send these letters out, we should be prepared for each of these
Entities to ask to see the agency agreement. They may, in fact, not be
Comfortable dealing with ena with just this letter.
