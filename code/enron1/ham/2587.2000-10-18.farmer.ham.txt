Just wanted to let you know that any entex information that I have put
Together is in the following directory.
O/logistics/entex... (mostly in the reference tab)
Also, most all of the historical volumes can be found in the risk folder:
O/erms/1 intra/texas/entex/databases
Let me know if you think of anything else that you need.
