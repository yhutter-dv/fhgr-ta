I need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced
Correctly in unify. Currently unify is adding all excess volume for each day
And pricing the first 10, 000 at a certain price and anything over 10, 000 at a
Different price. For example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first, meter
1384 may have 5000, and meter 1552 may have 5000. Unify currently prices the
First 10, 000 at a certain price, and 5000 at a different price. This is
Incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10, 000, each meter should be
Priced at the first tier level. Robert needs to set up one additional sale
Ticket and one additional buyback ticket, but he will not schedule gas to
These tickets. Anita luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when
She allocates the volumes each month. Equistar receives manual invoices each
Month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice,
And they also need to have each meter invoiced separately. I need to have
These tickets set up to clean up my unify draft invoices.
Thanks,

Kyle and I met with bryan hull this morning and we decided that we only need
1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up. The time period for both
Tickets should be july 1999 - forward.
The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of sitara #156337
Below:
The pricing for the new buyback ticket should be like tier 2 of sitara
#156342 below:
If you have any questions, please let me know.
