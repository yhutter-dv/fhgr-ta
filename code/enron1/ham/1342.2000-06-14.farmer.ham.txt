Subject: cilco
Per our conversation, the months relating to the cilco deal with ena - texas
Are may 1999 - sept 1999.
However, when howard and I talked about correcting the allocation in pops,
Howard is telling me that the cilco sale is tied to the transport (206)
Contract in pops. If we remove the sale b/t ena - tx and cilco and put the
Sale b/t ena - tx and the storage book, we no longer have a sale to tie to the
Transport. Let me know what you think as we did not discuss this.
Thanks!
