Hi,
The number is 281 - 370 - 7838.
I did not think of it, but without the pipe one has to balance ones own, doesn' t one. Of course the major problem was the people with hpl, not the counter - parties. Who' s doing that for you guys?
Jen came home for the memorial day weekend so we just bummed around. Saw pearl harbor, watched a few dvd' s, and ate way to much.
When you get time let us know about your" bad luck". I hope jake wasn' t helping you too much.
I have been occupying much to much time with our new sound system. We finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of yamaha stuff coupled to an equally large stack of klipsch speakers. Awesome is the only word to apply. I' m sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door. (it' s a young couple with a baby) (not near as nice as the other young couple I know).
Rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good.:)
Stock market still sucks, but as long as it pays for groceries and taxes we' ll be ok.
I' m off to get linda' s gas guzzlin, environment ruining, suv washed and buffed. Then I must re - stock my cd - r' s and load up on some more music. You can see how well i' m utilizing my time in doing productive things.
Later,
Ken
P. S. I thought waha was where all the pillaging of california was taking place.
