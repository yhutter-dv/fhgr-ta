Tom,
Please see the attached file estimating wellhead production for the month of
June. Please be advised that this is a preliminary estimate as I have yet to
Meet with the gas buyers (the meeting is monday at 2 pm) and to this date we
Have not received any noms for june. I will update you with any revisions as
They occur.
Thanks,
Vlt
