Dear christian friends,
Greetings in the name of our lord jesus!
We have two very urgent prayer requests. Our dear friend and a brother, david
Gatewood, the son of late otis gatewood, has been recently diagnosed a
Pancreas cancer. David and his wife sandy were two of the first people who
Introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago. In
1969 they came to croatia (yugoslavia at that time), as missionaries, with
Another couple, bud and beverly pickl. In order to get their resident visas,
They enrolled in a croatian language study program. I was their professor at
That time, and we became very good and close friends. David and sandy have
Been connected with the lord @ s work in croatia for all these years. Before
Leaving croatia in 1972, they adopted a little croatian girl, whom they
Raised with much love. She is a married woman now, and lives in colorado
Springs. David and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war, and
David taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a
Family. Your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love
David dearly.
Also, please, put me (mladen) on your prayer list. For several months now
I? Ve been having some prostate problems. Ten days ago my doctor requested a
Biopsy, and I am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday.
Dragica and I believe god listens and hears? Prayers of his people.
Please, join the church in croatia with your prayers.
Yours in his love and mercy,
Malden and dragica jovanovic
