Thanks darren, I appreciate it. We all know how often enerfin' s numbers
Change. Chances are we would have had to reverse any entry we made.

Sorry about this, victor. I didn' t even pay attention to the date. I was
Thinking this was october business. We will definitely be able to do
Somthing with this on our side and not involve the east desk.

Is this date really june of 1999? Hopefully we' re not just finding out about
This?
I don' t think we can even process this request. The east desk was not up and
Running on unify in june of 1999. All of our pathing for june of 1999 was in
Autonoms and it' s not y 2 k compatabile. With the volumes involved being so
Small and the accuracy of the data at enerfin in question, why don' t we let
This volume hit the new oba at enerfin as a ppa???
I welcome your thoughts.

Please get with the east desk on this. If they agree, we can roll the deal.

Daren,
On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the enerfin meter.
6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ena (202 k). Can the deal be extended
For 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that volume
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?
Thanks
