Your products to allow price limit orders. You can do this by:

2) in the lower right hand corner, verify that the:
- price tick size is where you want it (the price tick controls the minimum
Price increments which a customer can specify)
-" allowed" box is ticked under the" orders" section
- the max volume in the" orders" section is set where you want it.
If you do not do this, customers will not be able to place price limit orders
