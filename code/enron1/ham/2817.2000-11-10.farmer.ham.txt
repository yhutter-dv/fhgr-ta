Subject: neon discussion november 15
Here are some ideas for discussion this week.??
?
Next week we won' t be meeting, and after that we will have only two meeting
Times left before christmas.? Be thinking about what you' ll want to do as a
Group? For the last meeting, since it' ll be here real soon.? Some groups have
A party, with a chinese gift exchange (why is it called chinese?), or some
Go to eat somewhere and then go as a group in a van or suburban to look at
Christmas lights, etc.? If your group doesn' t have some tradition or
Enjoyable end to the semester, be imaginative and see if you can' t come up
With something fun to do.? Of course if you need help let me know!
