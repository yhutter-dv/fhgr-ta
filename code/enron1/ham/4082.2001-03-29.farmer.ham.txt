Oasis will be doing away with the temporary passwords for their on - line nom they are encourageing everyone to get on board. Let me know what you want to do. I have attached the agreement, and info on the nom/confirm cycles. I have been using it this week and it is pretty user friendly. The reporting capabilities are still being developed, but I am told it should be ready soon. Take a look for yourself@ www. Oasispipeline. Com.......... Logon: north..... Password: enron........ Currently, no intradays are allowed online (only by fax/email) because they want to approve same days, but they are looking at allowing them in the future.
