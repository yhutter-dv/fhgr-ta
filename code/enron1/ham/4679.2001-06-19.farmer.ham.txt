I needed the demand charge for april entered on supply deal 229758. It can stay on sale deal 157278 if you want, but it will need to be changed to a negative demand charge.

I have some changes to the defs deals for 2001. We need to add demand fees for the over delivery and excess charges. I have attached the spreadsheets in case you need them.
Prod. Deal demand fee
Feb 2001 157278 $11, 903. 17
March 2001 157278 $294. 85
April 2001 229758 $308. 53
