I am referring to ken seaman' s file which provides additional information.
We definitely need ken' s
File completed by aug lst. And distributed to our group, daren farmer, and

Be completed and can be linked on duplicate information. Thanks, pat

I am confused. What file do you want me to update; julie meyers file or ken
Seaman file?
Both files provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support
Groups.
To prepare both files I feel is a duplicate of my efforts. Please let
Know if you want both files updated
And the approximate time table for completion.

Robert,
Ken developed an industrial report before he left. It can be found at
O/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly /... There is one file for each
Month of 2000. I need you to update this for march. This will need to be
Distributed to gas control, logistics, and myself. Let me know if you have
Any questions.
