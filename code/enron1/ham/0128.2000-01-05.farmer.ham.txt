Subject: real time deal updates to path manager - test group
Beginning this week, we are actively testing the changes to path manager to
Receive real - time deal updates from sitara. To prepare for this, we would
Like to have a limited group of schedulers from each desk go thru a quick
Walkthru/training of the new features sometime early next week. This should
Only take about 30 minutes. Once they are comfortable with the features and
Performance, and once the testing is complete, we would like to migrate this
To unify production either next week or the week after. This should give us
An adequate adjustment period prior to the next bid week.
Once it is migrated to production, we can either roll it out to all
Schedulers or to selected schedulers via security.
Heather, could you please schedule some time with the designated schedulers,
Scotty, and myself early next week. A room with a projector would work best.
Thanks, d. N.
