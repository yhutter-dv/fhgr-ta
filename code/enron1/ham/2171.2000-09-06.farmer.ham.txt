Subject: mobil chemical - hpl meter #1256 - expense transport
Ed - can you help? I need to know the term of our existing transport expense
Deal with reliant entex to serve the referenced customer. We must have an
Existing contract that we can look up. Our existing deal to sell to mobil
Expires october 1. I am trying to make a two year sales offer beginning
October 1. If the transport expires before then, then we' ll need to call
Entex about a transport rate. Who is the correct dealmaker to call entex on
This matter?? I' d be happy to do it, but i' d be stepping on somebody else' s
Turf.
If the existing rate is indeed 5 cents plus 2. 02% fuel, that seems kind of
High. It' s a short haul - according to our field folk, we give the gas to
Entex at the la porte city gate, and it goes to the mobil plant at pasadena,
About 10 miles away at the most.
Any and all help appreciated.
