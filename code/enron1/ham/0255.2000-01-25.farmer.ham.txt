Subject: equistar sale off of tejas or midcon
Fyi.... For febo 0 only, equistar asked we deliver the gas under sitara
106736 to hpl meter 1373 instead (the plant it was originally going to is
Having some maintenance being done in feb).
While i' ve already change the delivery point in the sitara ticket, maybe
Something needs to bve done to the risk assignment.....
