Yes, the dollar amount is what we need to recoup from williams. I will take the credit with our payment to williams on the 25 th. Tenaska will send us their wire to us on the 24 th. I will make sure we receive the wire from tenaska before I send the wire to williams. I will also let james know about the volume for the agency fee. I thought it was suppose to be calculated on actual volume, not the nominated volume.

I have changed the demand fee. But, is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from williams? I don' t want to pay tenaska until we get the money from williams. Additionally, I believe that we need to keep the volume at 45, 000 for the admin fee, since we originally nominated 45, 000/day.
