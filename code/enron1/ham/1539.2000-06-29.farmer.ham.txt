Daren... I talked to cynthia in contracts and she said that ces deals cannot
Be extended and that a new contract has to be set up. How do you want to
Handle it?

I have rolled #143559 through july 2000 to cover the purchase from
Republic. We sell this gas to duke energy field services (#143558 for jan -
Apr, ces - duke energy field services, inc). The counterparty on this deal
Has been suspeneded, so I created #316727 under the counterparty of duke
Energy field services marketing, llc.
Hillary - please extend the ces - duke counterparty or attach the correct duke
Counterparty to this deal.
If you have any questions, let me know.

Republic royalty is one of my ces deals. They sent me an invoice for may
2000 production, but I do not see a deal for may. Does either of you know if
This deal was extended under a new deal number?
