Subject: re: boat
I believe the boat is 18 to 19 ft long and I do have a boat cover. I will bring the boat information with me tomorrow for anymore questions. I recently took it to the shop to get it ready for this season and the salesman said it looked brand new. It has a brand new battery and everything runs perfectly. Call me if you want to take a look at it.
