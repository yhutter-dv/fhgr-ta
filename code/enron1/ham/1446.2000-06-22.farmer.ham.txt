Application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts
Doesn' t have to be done by zone or compressor, in fact I am sure there will
Be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to
The pipelines total usage. Usually, short. I just do not think the market
Will let me lay off all of this risk. It would be really nice if we could
Get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts
But I am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue. Fuel should not
Cause imbalances on the transportation contract. A pipeline could be long
Fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject
Or hold in linepack the excess. It seems that we would look at fuel on a
Total basis.

We need to discuss further. My concern would be that how do we know what%
Hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
Fuel cost? Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance? I think
That pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
Retainage. But, if we retain fuel on ena transports, then we need to come up
With a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline.
Currently, this process is not in place.

What is the answer? Can the systems and processes handle this? Please let

Brenda,
As you know fuel is a big risk. One of the things we are trying to do is get
The shipper to pay fuel. This would mean we would purchase, transport and
Possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price. Can the
Downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?
