Subject: 98 - 1052 and 98 - 1534 (k extensions)
Daren,
I' m attempting to clean up my allocations, due to this being allocation close
Week for volume management.
98 - 1534 (delivery meter) overflowed into march, day 1 only, for. 30
Decatherms (sitara deal #163005 - start date 2/1/2000 and stop daate
2/29/2000). The 215 k is the only one at this meter for feb. 2000
Production. I don' t see a new sitara deal number being referenced nor do i
See the evergreen flag applied here. Please apprise if you can extend the
Ticket for this small amount for 3/1/2000 or if you want it handled
Differently.
98 - 1052 (delivery meter), allocated flow for 2/21 - 2/24/2000 with no k
Applied. Days 22 and 23 for february references the 215 k (sitara deal
#168884 start date 2/22/2000 stop date 2/23/2000. Sitara deal #201636 has
The same start and stop date as 168884 and neither references an evergreen
Flag or a new deal number).
Thanks
