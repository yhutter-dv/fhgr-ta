Last that I had, was that legal was reviewing the contract. Which sounds
Like it has been forgotten.
Cheryl: I would ask dan hyvl to find out where legal stands on this.

Julie,
What info do you have on the praxair deal (#70171)? Should this be on ena or
Hplc?

Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ena sales customers. I
Have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda
Needs. I am confused about praxair though.
The sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff/10/1/99.
The only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
Agreement.
Does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc? If it
Really needs to be under ena, we will need to un - do the 10/1/99 assignment to
Hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair.
Please advise.

Cheryl,
The counterparties with which ena currently sales gas are:
City of brazoria
Central illinois light company
D & h gas company, inc.
Markham gas
Merit energy partners
Praxair
Reliant energy - entex
Reliant energy - hl & p
Southern union company
Texas utilities fuel company (now txu fuel co)
Union carbide corporation
Unit gas transmission company inc
Ena has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most
Likely not happen again. (hpl will trade with those counterparties.)
All ena trades on hpl will be in sitara. We have reports which can be
Generated out of cpr that can list all deals by counterparty for ena. Let me
Know if you need something like that.
Let me know if you have any other questions.

Since i' m not sure exactly what gets entered into sitara, pat clynes
Suggested that I check with daren farmer to make sure that i' m not missing
Something (which I did below). While I am waiting for a response from him
And/or mary smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the
Above contracts.

Subject: ena sales on hpl
I am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
Could tell me if i' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
Which she is looking.
She is trying to draft a long - term transport/storage agreement between ena &
Hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets. In order to
Accomplish this, she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
Doing off of hpl' s pipe.
I had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy/sell activity
On hpl since 7/99. If I eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals, will
This give me everything that I need?
Are there buy/sell deals done with ena on hpl' s pipe that wouldn' t show up in
Sitara? Someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
On it' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
????? Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in sitara?
Is there anything else that i' m missing? I' m not real familiar with how some
Of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
Ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer!!!
Thanks in advance.
