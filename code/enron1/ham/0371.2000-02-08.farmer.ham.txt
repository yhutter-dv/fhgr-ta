Subject: gary,
Could you please remove scada/mips from the following hpl meters. These
Meters are where mid - texas interconnects with
Pg & e' s system, and there should not be any measurement taking place on hpl.
These meters were set up originally when we thought
That every meter on mid - texas should automatically have a corresponding meter
On hpl. This assumption is now incorecct.
