Subject: 98 - 1600 & 98 - 6725 needing k' s
Daren,
I hate to be a pest but here' s the deal on the above two meters:
98 - 1600 sitara deal #159194 expired on 2/29/2000. The flow for 2/2000 was
On the 215 k. This meter (del.) flowed 53. 863 for 3/2000. There is no new
Deal referenced, nor is the evergreen flag in effect.
98 - 6725 sitara deal #214948 expired 3/27/2000. No evergreen and no new deal
Referenced. This is a little premature but this meter is active monthly
And i' m thinking that it will flow for this month with no k being applied.
Thanks
