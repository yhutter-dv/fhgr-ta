Subject: 2000 plan allocations
Attached is a file with my allocations of texas operations to be used for the
2000 plan. However, please note that their are some problems/clean - up that
Needs to occur that I could not do.
As you requested, I have taken the% we allocated to gas assets last year and
Put the appropriate%' s into the appropriate group within gas assets as you
Have broken them out. Please note: gas network trading is the same group as
St gastexas (group 8) - tom martin is responsible for both. I have indicated
The appropriate%' s into the new buckets, but I was not able to zero out the
St gastexas group as the cells are protected. Consequently, the total column
Indicates that I have allocated over 100%. The #' s in gas network trading
Are correct. Will you please delete st gastexas so that no one will allocate
To it?
When the plan allocations were submitted last year, there was an error in
Rcl 160 - volume management. I thought we corrected it but it is still
Showing up incorrectly. Please move the 8% under east origin to st gaseast.
I was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected.
Please note: this is not a change from the plan, but a correction of an
Error.
I would appreciate you correcting these things for me, and forwarding the
Corrected version back to me for my records. I will be working with our
Management team on the 1/00 allocations, and will provide you those by
Friday. Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.
Management team: please review, and work on how we should be allocated for
1/00. We have changes for denver business, project sally, newco, etc. We
Will discuss in the staff meeting on tuesday, 1/18.
