Subject: july 2000 first of the month availabilities
Hey guys,
You may or may not be aware, but I am taking over coordinating changes with
Devon from amI effective 7/1/2000. These
Are the first preliminary numbers from devon. I will send information for
The lst to all of you, but the changes will only go to
The pipes affected. If you have any suggestions as to how this can be
Handled smoother, I would love to hear from you. Also,
If anyone else needs these volumes, please let me know.
Thanks for your help.
