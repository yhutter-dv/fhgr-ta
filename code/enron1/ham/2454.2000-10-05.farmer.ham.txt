Morning the 7 th of october. I have already submitted the nominations to
Lonestar for the weekend (7 th - 9 th), taking all gas to the plant. If they
Come up early, we have imbalance gas that will serve them. I have informed
Mary of this, and will give her a copy of the noms, #' s and contacts, etc....

We are finally beginning to put closure on our outage. It has been
Frustrating to say the least. We are currently projecting a late friday or
Early saturday morning startup barring any unseen problems.
