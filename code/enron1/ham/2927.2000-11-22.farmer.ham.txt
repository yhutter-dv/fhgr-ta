Kathy - - - - - here is what I know about cornhusker:
Our supply comes from apache & williams
Our market typicially is the plant (tenaska iv partners)
If the plant is down, brazos utility has the right to the gas if they want it
If brazos does not call for the gas, then we will sell off to whomever we can
We just get a flat fee on this gas per mmbtu, whether it goes to the plant or
Not
Daren farmer knows the specifics about the deal
Hope this helps, call with any questions.
Mark
