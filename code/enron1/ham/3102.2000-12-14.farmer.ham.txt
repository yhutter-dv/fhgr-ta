Subject: re: tenaska iv 10/00
Darren,
The demand fee is probably the best solution. We can use it to create a
Recieivable/payable with tenaska, depending on which way the calculation goes
Each month. How are pma' s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
Deal put in the system?
Attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
Today. Some of this info will change by the end of the month. As you can
See, there are some discrepancies between megan' s calculations and what is on
The general ledger. Ua 4 is also on my schedule. Unless the buys/sells are
Volumetrically balanced, we book an entry to balance the desk. This will
Change the calculation of what is due from/to tenaska. Should we be
Recording a ua 4 entry for cleburne? Is it addressed in the agreement with
Tenaska?

In most cases, ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
To the cleburne plant. However, for october 2000, the plant was down the
Majority of the month and ena sold off the supply, resulting in ena owing
Money to tenaska iv.
I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1, 798, 389. 73, which is the
Calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk. (please see the attached
Schedule.) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv. Do we need to pay
This amount (wire from ena to tenaska iv) or is there another way to do
This? This is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
The future.
Greg, troy, jim - please let me know what you think about settling this.
Megan - don' t pay the amount until we here from the greg, troy and jim.
Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we
Reimburse tenaska iv.

We have actuals. The larger of the two volumes is 1, 395, 000, which is
45, 000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine. I am having a
Problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements. It is showing up
With a jan 2003 delivery date. I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1
Only. Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36. I
Think this is confusing the system some how. Also, we still need the
Purchase deal for tenaska iv. It should be for a demand fee of $2, 571, 135. 73
Booked to the cleburne desk. We actually owe $1, 798, 389. 73, but I need to
Net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables. James
Is calling me every day asking for an update. Do you know when we will be
Able to get this in the system? I have attached my spreadsheet so you can
See the numbers.
