Please respond to hi, just wanted to let you know that lacy' s sugar levels are staying up pretty well. She was down to 51 this morning, but she took a shot last night & I guess she didn' t eat enough ice cream. She was mad at me cause I didn' t give her more than I did. But it' s so hard to know exactly how to handle it' cause she' s been going to bed a little high & getting up a little high. But anyway, she' s doing better & I guess she' ll always be mad & think i' m mistreating her. I stay stressed out every day not knowing if she got low after I left & passed out & no one would know it. I' m going to try to get a cell phone & have her call me when she gets there - - I think - - I don' t know - - she' ll be mad about that too. But the other night, she didn' t eat right after she took her shot, then didn' t eat anything fast acting & got in the truck to go over to phillip' s to get research info from his computer, got low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs. So that' s what scares me. She knew to eat righ!
T after she took that shot & didn' t. But she was high before she took it & I guess she didn' t think about it getting low. I don' t know what will happen to her when she leaves home.
But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we' re going to dallas to look for the prom dress & shoes, don' t know if we will stay all night or not. I haven' t talked to shane & shelley. I wanted to stay & go to saturn rd. To church & go to the singles class. But I don' t know what shane & shelley have planned. So we' ll be back either sat. Night or sun. Lacy has to be back to work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once. So, wish us luck. Any donations will be appreciated! I hear they' re more than I was expecting. But anyway, I don' t intend to go overboard. Maybe there will be some sales.
Hope my grandsons are doing ok. I bet they were glad that their daddy got back home sunday. Hug them for me & tell cole that mimI can' t wait to see his bunkbeds. Love ya' ll
