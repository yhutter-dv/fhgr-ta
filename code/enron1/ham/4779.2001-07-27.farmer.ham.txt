Subject: mgI supply jan 2001
Darren:
I have a price issue with mgI supply for january 2001. For deal 551414, we have tiered pricing for days 13 - 16. The first 20, 000 at $8. 71 and everything over at agua dulce gdp + $0. 01. MgI has the deal priced at the gdp + $0. 01 only. They do not have the $8. 71. Should this pricing be tiered? MgI would owe us $10, 600. 00 if we go with their pricing.
