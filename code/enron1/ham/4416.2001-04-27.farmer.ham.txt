Subject: re: hpl transport contracts
I would think that the first contract should go the aep. Ena won' t be selling to equistar
Off of channel for at least three months. Ena will have to get a transport agreement with
Hpl or channel.
On the second contract: is hpl making the sale or ena? Is it a sale that is going
To aep. I know we are serving a small entex point off of oasis. Is that for convenience,
Can hpl sever the point some other way?
Someone let me hear what you think.
Thanks
Bob

Subject: hpl transport contracts
I spoke with daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of:
1. Channel - 012 - 15600 - 02 - 069 ena using hpl' s capacity - selling to equistar on channel
2. Oasis and pgev - hpl is using ena' s capacity
3. Tejas ship and tejas gas - daren says we don' t do business often on these pipes as ena, but we always have the possibility that we will at any time, so ena would need it' s own transport contracts
Let me know if anyone has questions. Thanks!
