Its a monthly nom for 413447
You' re right - the swing deal 413462 needs to be extended to match the term
Of 413447, as does the buyback 413472

Lee,
On deal 413447 (chevron@ olefins), we have a flex nom of 6, 000 to
12, 000/day. Is this a monthly nom or daily nom? Will we have a swing deal
With them for the winter? The current swing deal is for oct only. For oct,
They have pulled an average of 16, 000/day.
