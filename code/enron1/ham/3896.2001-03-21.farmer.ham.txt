Subject: urgent
Ed has requested that we compile a list this morning of all parties/points which we owe gas to, in the event that we need to find a home for excess volumes today. Please email me a list of any meters/contracts that you are aware of. I am compiling an interim list based upon the rtu variance report for march, however, I don' t want to rely on this list as you may be engaged in balancing at meters with variances.
Thank you,
Mary
