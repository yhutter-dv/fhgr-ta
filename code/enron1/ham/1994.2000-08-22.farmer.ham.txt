Karen,
I' ve looked in pops and on day 16 of january 1999, I see a total confirmed
Volume of 61, 365 and an actual of 62, 151. If i' m understanding you
Correctly, you' re asking me to allocate all of this volume to deal #51862.
If so, that' s incorrect. Several deals are associated the this days volume.
Please write back or phone back with further details.
Thanks

Jackie,
Volume is allocating to deal number 51862 on 1/16/99 on meter 984132, however
The deal does not have this day on it. Please have 1/16 added to the deal so
The error will clear.
Thanks and if you need additional info, let me know.
Karen
