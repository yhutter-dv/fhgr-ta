Daren:
During the months of october 1999 and november 1999, gas flowed into hpl' s
Pipeline at the above meter. This gas was previously transported by eog
Resources to mobil (beaumont) with the excess being purchased. The deal
That eog resources transport contract (012 - 36702 - 02 - 001) moved gas to mobil
Beaumont expired a the end of september, 1999, but gas continued to flow into
Hpl' s pipeline. Currently, these volumes are being recorded to the hpl
Strangers gas contract. Logistics needs a deal to purchase these volumes.
