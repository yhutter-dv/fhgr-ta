Subject: jeff' s corner - - a message from the ceo on the intranet
As much as i' d like to, I can' t get to every floor or to every location across enron to talk with you about what is going on around the company. So i' m doing the next best thing. Beginning today, you can access a videotaped message from me about our second quarter results and our new strategy concerning enron broadband services. As you listen, I hope you find the information valuable and this new way of communicating easy and timely. I plan to do this regularly, so watch your e - mail for future messages. Thanks for listening and have a great day.
