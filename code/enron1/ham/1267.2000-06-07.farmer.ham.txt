Subject: may hours survey
If you guys remeber, I reminded you all last tuesday, 5/30, in our staff
Meeting to be on the look - out for the attached message from james re: 5/00
Hours. The deadline was friday, 6/2, and unfortunately, very few of you
Responded. I understand how busy each of you are and you have expressed your
Concerns on the process burdening you. However, there are pressures
Internally to provide information to sr. Management on a more timely basis.
We need to do our part. Please respond asap, but no later than thursday,
6/8. Please contact jennifer or sharI if you have any questions or need any
Help.
Additionally, for those of you who are involved in bridgeline, we will be
Preparing a bid for our services going forward per a discussion I had with
Trevor yesterday. Therefore, the may drivers are very critical to that
Process also.
So everyone, please get your info in asap. I appreciate your help.

Subject: may hours survey
Attached please find the hours survey and instructions for the month of may,
2000.
I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself
To those of you I have not yet met. I am being asked to take a direct roll
In the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model (fka
Transaction cost model). In the past, I have directed the implementation of
Several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
Operations pricing model (opm). Over the past couple of weeks my
Observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
Data used in the model. It will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
Get to a satisfactory level of data quality. This process can start with
This months data collection efforts. Please pay particular attention this
Month as the" bar is being raised" by the management of energy operations for
Data quality and timeliness.
While completing the survey, take this time to review last month' s numbers.
Please return these surveys to sharI mao by end of day friday, june 2.
Please note the following changes:
The nat gas rc' s will now see deal validation and transportation rate
Activities therefore, these surveys will be notably longer but will not
Necessarily take more time
If the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on,
Please do not type any activities in the survey. Contact jennifer reside at
#35971 to discuss how to proceed.
If you have any questions relating to the model or this survey, or are unable
To meet the survey due date, please call jennifer reside at #35971 (sharI is
On vacation this week).
