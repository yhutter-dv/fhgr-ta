Daren, I will still have interconnect variance at this deal. It will be
1191626 instead of 1746918.

Daren,
This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out. Unfortunately, I do
Not allocate pgev. Also, sherlyn has actualized pgev and she has the
Support from the pipeline for the 1746918 volume. Please let me know if i
Had missed something in our conversation. Thanks
