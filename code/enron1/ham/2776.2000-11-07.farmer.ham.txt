Subject: deals under wrong counterparty from weekend
I need some assistance getting these deals corrected in the system for the
Weekend, so that I can get my errors clear. I have tried to change the
Counterparty, but I am not able. Jackie is out again today, so, I will be
Behind the proverbial 8 - ball and would greatly appreciate your help clearing
These things up.
Deal ticket 468688 p - mgI is in system as hplc purch. The correct entity is
Ena im texas, ena made the orig. Sale
Deal ticket 468110 d 2 d to deliver to central desk at humble is on ena, these
Tickets have always been hplc and not ena.
Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to speed the process.
I need to have all of my errors clean today.
Thank you,
Mary
