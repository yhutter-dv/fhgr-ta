Per our conversation, we do not have any numbers with 2 zeros in front.
980070 does not exists in mips.
Thanks.

Peggy and patricia,
This is the last allocation exception I have to clear. When you have the
Time, could you check the volumes for gas days 28 - 31 for october, 1999. I
Phoned peggy this morning regarding this meter, and apparently it is outside
Measured. I need to verify that flow occured so that I can have a deal (s)
Extended to allocate the flow to.
Thank you again for all of your assistance, I really appreciate all that you
Have done.
Mary
Daren,
I am going to leave a copy of the meter volume, and prior purchases to review.
Thank you for you assistance and patience.
Mary
