Subject: ena origination track
All,
Ena is building an ena origination track similar to that of the trading track. Originators on both the gas & power side at the vp level have bought into the development of this program. The management of the program will be the originators themselves under louise kitchen. There will be structured rotations for the analysts & associates who join this program with a clear objective in mind - final rotation will be in origination.
The below people, according to our records, are currently in your groups. These candidates have been identified as they have completed at least one relevant rotation and/or have performed well in the previous prc. Prior to contacting the below analysts & associates, I want to ensure your buy - in/recommendation of these candidates. All selected candidates would be formally interviewed by the origination management team (both gas & power) prior to joining the program.
I would be grateful for your early response as we are looking to schedule a date in november to commence interviews.
If you have any questions, please let me know and I will be happy to explain the program in greater detail.
Kind regards,
Karen
