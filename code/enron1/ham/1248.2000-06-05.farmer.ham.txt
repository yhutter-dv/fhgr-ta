The accomplishments by 6/19 is for directors and above - to sally.
Individual groups under sally will probably set their deadlines prior to the
Smaller prc' s. That is correct.
I did not understand that promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting
With sally our notes indicate that sally wanted some prior discussions on
This subject. Nor did I understand that the employee had to be in their
Role for 1 year. Our notes indicate that this would be the general rule of
Thumb. I thought the promotion discussion would be an agenda item of prc.
We believe that discussion of promotions will also occur at the prc.
Additionally, I understood the mid - year promotion listing would not be as
Extensive as year - end, maintaining the year - end as the primary promotion
Time. We understood the same.
