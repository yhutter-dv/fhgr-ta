According to the contract brief I received, the 2. 175 is a 1999 price. I
Believe my pricing is correct. Bob or darren may be able your questions
Better.

I got an invoice for the gas we bought from apache for tenaska iv and they
Have a different price. For deal 384247, we have a price of 2. 285 and a
Demand fee of 0. 457 for 25, 000/day. Apache is billing us at 2. 175 with no
Demand charge. Can you verify this price for me and let me know which is
Correct?
Thanks,
Megan
