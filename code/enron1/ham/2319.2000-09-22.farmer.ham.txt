Subject: neon material week of sep 27
Leaders:

Three things:
??????
Here is this week' s material.? There' s probably way too much stuff to use it
All, so I wouldn' t even try.? Pick out the things and questions that you
Feel are the most important and will hit your group the best.? Just remember
That this material is only one part of what needs to be happening in your
Neon group.? The getting to know and share with each other is critical - - use
One of the icebreaker activities you have (even if it seems cheesy) or
Somehow ask questions and get the group talking with each other or about
Themselves.
?
See the note above the material about the cd in your neon box.
?
Finally, I haven' t let you know about the new leaders we have working with
Us, specifically with carol poe and the backors in neon silver - - leslie and
Debbie bills!? Welcome debbie and les!
?
Keep up the great work!
