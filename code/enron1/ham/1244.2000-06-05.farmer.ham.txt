Subject: new su bridge
The new sitara to unify bridge monitor is in production.
The monitor shows deals in error state (failed) or in queue to bridge
(pending) - for deals going to unify from sitara.
You will find it under - start - programs - trading - sitara - su bridge
Monitor.
You may need to load the borland bde v 5. 0 software to use this, if not
Already loaded.
We enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool.
If deal is in an error state on the sitara side - we have not sent it over to
Unify.
If the deal in an error state on the unify side - sitara has sent it to unify
- however - it is in the unify failed deal group.
You can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit.
The date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal.
Start date and stop date - are begin and end date of deal.
Sitara deal id - as well as - eol deal id.
Indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal.
If you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the status = p
Deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions
(awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal). If you
Release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have
Access to multiple desks.
You can hit the refresh button to re - query the data - or set the auto refresh
On the tool bar.
We did not build filter by business unit for multiple reasons:
- the expense to build the filter.
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing.
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it.
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error
State - once petro can/suncor/sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
Number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column.
- if you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel
Feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel.
If you have any questions or problems - please call the sitara hotline.
