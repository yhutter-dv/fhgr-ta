Daren,
According to vance' s response to lauri' s email, the nominations should be
Revised upwards approximately 650/d on the gathering contract (s) at this
Meter. There is currently nominations of 1, 353/d (1, 153 gathering and 200
Transport). The flow should be around 2, 000/d. Is it alright to include the
Increase of 650/d with the other revisions to be made after trading on friday?
Bob

Lauri,
Effective 3/1/2001, hplc amended its contract with royal production changing
The price to 100% hsc less $0. 16 and extending the term through 2/28/02.
Consequently, for march, hplc should be purhasing volumes from two wells at
Meter 5310. Effective april, hplc amended the same contract releasing the
L. G. Talbert #2 lease in the committed reserves agreement; mike morris is the
Gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000 mmbtu/d. For april I nom
1132/d; bob, we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental
Production at this point.
Thanks,
Vlt

Louis cox with copano (the interconnecting party at this meter) informed me
That effective march lst, we should have been buying incremental gas from
Royal production at this point since they were no longer selling it to
Copano. There have been no changes in the producer services noms at this
Point, however. This point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow
I have access to shows noms of 1332 mm with bav of 3497 mm on march 18 th.
Bob/vance - could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should
Be? Copano says they' re not getting the gas in april either, but they do not
Know how long hplc is purchasing the incremental gas from royal. Please let
Me know what the resolution is. Thanks.
