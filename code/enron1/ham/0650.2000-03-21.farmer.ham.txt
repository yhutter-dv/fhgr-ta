Daren and lauri:
We do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters. When mips receives an
" incomplete" from the parent meter it sends a - 0 - to pops. Yes, this is a
Big problem. Our pops team (romeo d' souza) has identified this problem and
Notified mips. However, he was told this was not a priority item. In the
Mean time we are overriding the volumes in pops with the estimated volumes.
This particular meter was correct last night, the 14 th rolled last night from
Mips and overrode the bav with a - 0 - from day 14 forward.
This was corrected this morning and the meter re - allocated.
Thanks,
Charlotte

Subject: pg & e texoma volumes
In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that valero texoma
(#71) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3/14 causing an out of balance
At the meter in excess of 500, 000 mm month to date. The more critical part of
This problem, however, is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
Of the hplc deals. This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have
Not been picked up in tom' s p & l and are, instead, sitting in ua 4. To the
Extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value, the p & l may take a
Hit when these actual volumes flow through.
I realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a
Problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it' s discovered.
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
Correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible.
Please give me a call if you have any questions.
