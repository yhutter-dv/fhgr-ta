Subject: hplc/tglo deals
Darren:
I have a request from jim coffey that I hope you can help me with. He wants to know the cost of supplying the gas to the glo. I can follow the ena deals in path manager, but I am having a hard time with the hplc deals. It looks like we were using gas from the 215 contract. I can' t tell, though, how the gas got to the 215. Can you tell me where we got the supply for hplc to sell and at what price? I need to know for jan through may. The glo deal numbers are below, if you need them.
