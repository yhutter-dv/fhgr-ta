This is a call out meter. I think the best person to help you would be kathy
Benedict in volume management.

Daren, i' m looking at s 93481 for 01/00. 3, 461 mmbtu was scheduled to copano
P/l in 02/00 and the counterparty was paid. In 05/00 the volumes were
Reversed from this deal. Would you be able to tell why they were reversed?
I' m trying to determine if this is a valid recoverable item. Thanks.
