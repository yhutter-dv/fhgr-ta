Subject: hunter singing at christmas program
Here' s a video of the three and four year old kids singing at the christmas
Program at church last year.
It' s about a minute and half in length.
Hunter drowns out the other kids with his monotonal singing.
He' s holding a staff and is dressed as a shepherd with a black headband on
The row below the back row angels.
