Elizabeth,
Sorry, I can' t remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what.
Were you looking into this issue for me or was it passed to someone else.
Please see the email below. I believe the system is pulling in the wrong
Price for waha. Wtx. If. M. I.. For 5/00 production. The deal #is 250237.
I looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $2. 95.
The price of $2. 95 plus $1 would equal the price of $2. 96 which is what duke
Is
Claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $3. 95.
Thanks, stephanie (3 - 6004)

Elizabeth,
I have a pricing discrepancy and I was not sure if I send this to you or
Oneil.
It' s for duke energy, 5/00 production, deal #250237. Duke believes our
Price is too high. The system downloaded a price of $3. 95
The price should be waha. Wtx. If. M. I., which is $2. 95 for that month. (
Waha. Wtx. If. M. I. + 1) duke believes we should have paid them $2. 96.
I think the system pulled in the wrong price. Could you please let me know
If you handle this pricing issue or someone else?
Thanks, stephanie (3 - 6004)
