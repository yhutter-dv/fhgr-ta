Subject: me again
Did you survive bid week?
I hear you lost another employee (stacey). If you need someone to work for you I suppose i' m free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any staff left?
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)
Gotta run. Almost have my * &% $#!!@ #taxes done. If people had to write a personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some big changes. It sucks.?? Later,? Ken??
