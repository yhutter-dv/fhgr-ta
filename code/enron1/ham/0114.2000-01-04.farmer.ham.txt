Rhonda, I took a look at the missing service rates report and I don' t have
The rates to input into the system. The best I can do is input them if you
Provide them to me. I am sorry that I can' t help more... Call me if you need
To at xl 836.
Greg sent me the expense reconciliation reports that have come out were:
Powder river gathering - expense
Powder river gathering - revenue
East texas gathering - expense
King ranch gas processing - expense
Humble gas pipeline - expense
Channel industries - expense
Tgpl - expense
Black marlin - expense
I' m here till noon, and reachable after that at 713 - 385 - 7612. I think that
Charlotte or someone in the logistics group can help with these rates.
