Nick,
I understand that they terminated their agreement. However, I don' t feel
That we can confiscate their production. We need to either pay them for the
Gas, or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter.
Given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month, i
Would guess that they want to be paid. We won' t know that until we call
Them. I don' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
Explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
Shut - in.
Please let me know if I can do anything further to assist.
Mary
