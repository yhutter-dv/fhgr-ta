Subject: tenaska agreement
Darren,
Do you know what the situation is with getting that tenaska agreement signed? It is on a list to be assigned to hpl in the sale and I don' t think it has ever been executed - - I know you left me a message a week or so ago about this - - is there any information that I owe you?
