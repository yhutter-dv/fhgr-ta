Bob,
Go ahead and accept the nom revision. I believe that this is with pge, not
El paso. How do the rest of our noms compare with eog? I f they have a
Higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom
There. In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as
Possible to what we have in the system now.

Daren,
Charlotte hawkins is having trouble confirming the volume of 5, 733 with el
Paso. El paso will not confirm the volume that high. Eog revised their
Nomination as follows:
C/p name meter #orig nom rev nom
Eog res. 6296 5, 733 2, 300
Will you approve revising the volume in unify down to 2, 300? Please advise.
Thanks.
Bob
