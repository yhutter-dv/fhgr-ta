Vance,
What is the price and volume that should be entered for october? Apparently,
Engage changed their name to coastal was the reason the deal ticket was
Created that way.

Bob,
You are correct, I did request a ticket at meter 5848 as a spot purchase.
However, i' m not sure why the ticket was created in the name of coastal; it
Should have been in the name engage energy us, lp. As for october, hplc is
Buying this package of gas on a" spot" basis and a ticket should be created
And entered in to sitara.
Thanks,

Vance,
On august 28, you sent a request to enter a spot ticket for september
Production on engage energy, meter #5848, 240 mmbtu/d. The ticket was
Entered as a purchase from coastal merchant energy, l. P. A volume of 304
Mmbtu flowed on meter #5848 on 10/1/00. Should there be a spot purchase at
Meter #5848 in october? Please advise. Thanks.
Bob
