Daren,
I believe the best way to enter the fee into sitara would be as a demand fee
In your example #1.
If we do the fee this way, we will not double up the volumes.
I have attached my spreadsheet for support:
The most current worksheet is tab #2 marked final
Column g is the over - delivery quantity total is 17, 278 mmbtus
Column s is the daily dollar amount for the over - delivery quantity due hplc
$1, 008. 87
Column t is the daily dollar amount for the over - delivery quantity due the
Customer $519. 73.
Thanks -

Katherine,
There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into sitara:
1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.
2) I need you to give me volume (s) and a price to input into the deal. I
Can' t just input a dollar amount in sitara.
Let me know how you want to handle it.
