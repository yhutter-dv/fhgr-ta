Subject: natural gas
Our ceo was contacted by a david gardner, president of gardner energy in
Houston regarding a five - year package of gas. I spoke to him only briefly
But did not get a good feeling about him or his deal. Do you know of this
Firm? I was unable to pull up anything on the internet. I suspect he' s
Just a marketer.
Don' t spend any time on this. I was just curious as to whether or not you
Know of him or his firm. Thanks.
