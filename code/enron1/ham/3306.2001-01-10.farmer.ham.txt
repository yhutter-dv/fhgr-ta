Subject: kcs buy/sell
In light of december' s allocation of actual volumes at kcs #9797, it looks as
Though we need to reduce the nom at both this meter and at tejas riverside,
#3543, where the" sell" portion of this buy/sell occurs for the remainder of
January. December actual receipts at #9797 were 15, 889 mm or an average of
513 mm/day. The january nomination is 864 mm/day. I think it needs to be
Reduced to approx 345 mm/day effective 1/11 or there may be a large diffence
Between what we buy at the wellhead and what is delivered back to kcs at
Tejas riverside. Any info you could get from gas control or kcs about actual
Flow current month would help nail this nomination down. Thanks.
