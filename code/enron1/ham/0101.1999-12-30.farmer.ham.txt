Subject: koch three rivers, #6722
I spoke with larry zamit this morning regarding the outage january 1 through
6. He agreed to hold the gas for us and batch it throughout the rest of
January. At this point we have 3, 007 nominated for 1/1/00 and that is what
He has agreed to hold.
Questions?? Give me a call.
