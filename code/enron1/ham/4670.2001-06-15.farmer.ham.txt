The contract (96007529) should have expired under ena, but because of the timing of the expiration, it got" assigned" to aep/hpl (96060798). Therefore, for informational/historical purposes, I extended the term under 96060798 thru 5/31/01.
Someone from linda' s group will have to extend the term under the original contract in order for the deal to be attached.

I did a search and found no deals for may for this counterparty. Call
Daren farmer at 713 - 853 - 6905, and he could probably put the deal in for
You.

Need your help again....
D & h gas company, faxed their 05/01 volume support for hpl meter 428
(980428), whihc reflects ena gas sales to d & h for 5/11/01, 143 mmbtu and
5/31/01 for 286 mmbtu for a total of 429 mmbtu for 05/01. He deal last
Month (04/01), was sa - 70120. I don' t have see a sales draft under ena or
Hpl for 05/01 sales to d & h, nor do I see any 05/01 sales deal under
Sa - 70120.
Can you assist me in finding out if there was a sale to d & h in 05/01, and
If so, what is the deal number and where is sales draft?
Thanks!
