Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957/state tract 121 (meter 785)
Fred or anita,
I just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same
Page. From my understanding, the allocation for meter 785: state tract 121
Is supplied from bryancy braumley. Prior to 09/1/00 bryancy would calculate
Flow from certain wellheads, total this volume, and then send us an
Allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land
And hpl (sale from cleco) at meter 785. Effective 09/1/00 a compressor was
Put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor, as well as the
Gas from meter 9662 (deal 137595 sales from dewbre), and is now measured at
Meter 3527: tivolI station. For bryancy' s allocation, she must take the meter
Statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662' s flow. Once this is done,
She can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land
And hpl (cleco) like she has done previously. I believe meter 785 is now a
Check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter.
For 9/00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco, deal 397957
And 449243. Per discussions with daren farmer, danny conner, and jennifer
Martinez, I have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use
449243 as the correct deal number. Therefore, fred boas and I have zeroed
Out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal
449243. Deal 397957 was priced at ship less. 18 which was incorrect and deal
449243 is priced at ship less. 15. Therefore, an adjustment will generate
For 9/00 for the difference in price and the change in location. The
Allocated volume for cleco did not change. However, I am not sure that
Bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl
(cleco). I have spoke to her, as well as jennifer martinez, and curtis
Funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma' s for volume differences.
In addition, I have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a
Callout\swing effect 9/00. For october and succeeding months, the volume
Should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662. Then
Byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land
And hpl (cleco). The texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and
The hpl (cleco) deal is at meter 3527. Fred mentioned that the texas general
Land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on
That yet.
Please let me know if something I have stated is not your understanding or
You need something more done on my end. Also, let me know who is going to be
Doing this monthly allocation. It might be beneficial to have one person
Doing all the points (meters 3527, 9662, 785). Thanks for your help!!!
