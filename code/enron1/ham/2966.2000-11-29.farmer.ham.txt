Subject: samson lone star limited
Daren, I am trying to process two invoices from samson resources co. (samson
Lone star limited) for september 2000 and october 2000. The volume is at
Carthage hub. I have not been able to find this volume in unify for either
Month. Samson has faxed me their confirmation and your name is listed as the
Contact. Do you know the sitara number for these deals? Thanks.
