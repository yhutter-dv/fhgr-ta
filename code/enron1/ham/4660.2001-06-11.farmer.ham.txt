Subject: tristar gas company may 2001
I have a problem with tristar for may 2001. The deal number is 779345. They sent me an invoice for 40, 000 from the 24 th to the 31 st at $3. 975. In our deal, we only have 6, 000 on the 24 th at $3. 975. Did you do a deal for 40, 000? I can' t find a deal on oasis or on hpl for this amount.
