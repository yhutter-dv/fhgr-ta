Subject: sanchez oil & gas - 20, 000/d, harris county, texas
Daren, sanchez oil & gas has 3 wells (their highlander wells) connected to hpl at meter no. 98 - 9760. These wells are flowing approx. 20, 000/d and sanchez would like to have a bid for the gas beginning december 1 for 1 year. Their term will be up w/hpl then. Can we get a transport bid from hpl to wherever you need the gas and I can buy it at receipt point less their transport or we can buy it at the meter. I know the rate will not be" pretty", but there are other reasons sanchez may prefer to have enron buy their gas. Let' s discuss at your convenience. (there is no rush now, buit i' d like to be looking at it in the next month). Thanks.
