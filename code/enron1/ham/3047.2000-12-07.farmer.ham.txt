Gary,
When spinnaker got paid, the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the
Month. Since spinnaker was paid gas
Daily pricing for the month, there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when
The volumes are re - sent over on the actual
Day of flow. In my calculations (using gas daily less $. 21 as the price) we
Are going to owe spinnaker an additional
$220, 398. 57.
One issue that needs to be addressed is this: should the additional money go
Directly to spinnaker since they are allocating
Out october 2000 production payments to ranger and houston exploration?
Attached is a spreadsheet showing where I came up with the extra money owed:
Thank you all!!

Ps this does not address the issue between the onshore and offshore meter,
This is just addressing the redistribution
Of volumes for the month of october.
