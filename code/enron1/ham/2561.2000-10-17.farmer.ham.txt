Tenaska iv has been operating without a" gas agency agreement" since that
Portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31. We met with sandy
And the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms (which i
Think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
Would be charged by the desk). Should we be concerned with the amount of
Time this is taking? That is, is there any risk we face (bank - wise or
Otherwise) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
Through the bank consent process?
