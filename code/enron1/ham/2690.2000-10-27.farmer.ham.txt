I checked the meter for september, there are measured volumes of 36, 085 dth
For the month. The meter had a purchase from mjg at the beginning of the
Month. It looks like it was zeroed after the fact. We are going to need to
Pay someone for this production.... I think we may need to extend the deal
Until the point at which the meter was actually shut - in. I do not agree with
Allocating this gas to strangers, it is not a true line gain/loss, or a
Direct result of any pipe/well work.
Please advise so that anita and I can clean this up as promptly as possible.
