Subject: month end close schedule * revised *
Changes are in blue.
Last month there was some confusion from several schedulers I spoke to about when changes could be made to (august) after the cut off: as noted in the table, after friday, august 31 st at 6 pm there can be no changes (i. E. Re - nominate, re - track, re - balance, bridge back to sitara etc.) made to august production until wednesday morning, september 5 th.
At 6 pm friday (or before if you are ready) I will be by to pick up the reports and exceptions dialogue.
Thx
