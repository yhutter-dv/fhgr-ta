All,
Intern referral from mike mcconnell. Not sure his background/education is a
Fit for technology? Maybe other groups are looking for summer interns with
Some energy related experience. He worked last summer at dynegy in gas
Control and scheduling.
Please let me know if you have any interest.
Thanks,
Robert

Subject: resume for summer internship
April 20, 2000
Dear mr. Mcconnell:
Thank you for taking the time to consider this resume for a possible summer
Internship with enron. I understand that you have spoken to my father, scott
Wells at texaco, and he has informed me that enron accepts interns only when
A department asks for one.
I' d like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer.
I interned for dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms
For working in the gas industry. I worked on the trading floor as a gas
Scheduler, and after only a month I was controlling the northeast cng
Pipeline. This helped because I really got to learn were many of the
Northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points.
Other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of
The gas bought and sold that morning. Throughout the day I would work on
Projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the
Trading floor. It was all a great learning experience for me and I hope to
Use my knowledge again this summer for enron.
I would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper human
Resource personnel so that I might be able to contact him or her in hopes of
A future internship possibility. I will be available to have a start date of
May 15 th and be available for employment until school resumes in late august.
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from someone in your
Company at his/her earliest convenience. Please feel free to call me at
940 - 323 - 0891, or email me at rollins 50@ aol. Com.
Sincerely -
Sean wells
