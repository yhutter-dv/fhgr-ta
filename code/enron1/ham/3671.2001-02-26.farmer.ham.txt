Subject: hpl deal downloads
I' ve attached two files with hpl deal information. The file named hpl deals
With 3 rd parties contain all hplc deals and ena deals on hpl. I plan to send
This file to aep by tueday morning unless I hear of any objection. The
Second file named ena texas offsystem deals contains deals that i' m not sure
If they are a part of the sale or not. I am asking david baumbach to review
This file to let me know what needs to be excluded. I will hold off on
Sending the second file until their is consensus on the content. - tommy
