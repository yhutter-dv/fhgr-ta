Really need to have these adjustments made in pops today. Please let me know
If you can help with this. Thanks.

I have reviewed the entex actuals and adjusted gas control' s entex factor for
The month of may. I have found that entex estimates have been overstated by
Approximately 10. 0 mmcf/day.
Romeo:
Will you make sure the estimates that are in pops are corrected to reflect
The new volumes. This should help reduce some of the ua 4 that daren and pat
Are trying to locate.
The attached file has the changes that need to be made. Please let everyone
On this mailing list know once the changes have been made.
If you have any questions please call me at 36449.
Thanks
Gary h
