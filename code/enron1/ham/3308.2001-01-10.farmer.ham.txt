Subject: can we still be friends
This has not been a good day for me but I do want to thank each of you for
All of the help you have given me during the last 7 months. Also, the great
Times we' ve had working and laughing together. Now for the bad or good news,
The 24 th of jan will be my last day as I have excepted a new position at bp
Amoco. It is with great pleasure knowing that I did beat mark mccoy over
There. Thanks again and we will still be friends. Ej
