Bob, we currently have a total of 16. 817 mmbtu/d nominated for purchases at meter 098 - 9862 as follows:
Spinnaker exploration company, l. L. C sit 379424 5, 886/d 27%
Ranger oil company sit 533410 5, 886/d 27%
The houston exploration company sit 535119 5, 045/d 23%
It appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132, which shows 0 as the expectted volume. Texas glo has historically transported about 23% of the gas at the n. Padre is. Block 883 l.
Once it starts flowing, the incremental 10, 000 mmbtu/d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above.
