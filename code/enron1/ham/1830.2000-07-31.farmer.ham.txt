Robert,
I never saw the july industrial spreadsheet. This must be set up for
August. It was a file developed by ken seaman.
Thanks, pat

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for july? I am a little
Concerned with the long weekend coming up. I believe that we agreed that
These would be set up by the 3 rd work day, which would be friday the 7 th.
(six days of flow.) I definitely don' t think that we should any later. It
Would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.
Additionally, we need to get the industrial spreadsheet up and running
Again. This report is very beneficial to gas control, industrial traders and
Schedulers on call.
Let me know what you think.
