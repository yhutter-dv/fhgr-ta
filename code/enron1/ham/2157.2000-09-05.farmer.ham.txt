Donna,
A request was brought up this week that I would like you to run by the
Managers for input:
- add the deal price to the sales and supply list windows of path manager
This seems more significant based on the transactions from eol.
This has been mentioned in the past, but has had some related" baggage":
- impact on performance, may run slower. Could make it an option so you pay
The price when you need it.
- ability to show tier info. Maybe just use the work" tiered" and not try
To represent the actual pricing
- agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and
Fixed price offset (ie 98% of if. Transco. Znl +. 02)
This column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user
Preference.
Let me know what you hear. D. N.
