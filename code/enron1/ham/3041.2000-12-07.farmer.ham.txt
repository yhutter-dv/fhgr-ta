Subject: txu lone star
I am working on clearing an old txu lone star/gas distribution balance from
8/99 and 9/99. We originally billed txu on nominated quantities and they
Have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments. These are brokered deals where
We sold to txu and purchased from exxonmobil and highland. Txu has provided
Meter support since the deals were on lone star pipeline, however, I am
Unsure how to have volume management reallocate.
For example, we originally sold 10, 000 mmbtu on 8/3/99 to txu and purchased
1, 200 mmbtu from highland energy and 8, 800 mmbtu from exxonmobil. Txu shows
The total amount of gas on 8/3/99 was 9, 240 mmbtu. How should the purchase
Piece be allocated between exxonmobil and highland since this was a brokered
Deal?
