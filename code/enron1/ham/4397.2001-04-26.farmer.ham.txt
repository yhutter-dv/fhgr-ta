The question is not that" cut and dry". However, for the month of march enron paid spinnaker@ if hsc - $0. 085.
Currently the volume is posted under deal ticket #144271 with is the deal tick for gas daily production.
This production should be moved to deal ticket #144264 with is the if.

Tess,
We probably should be invoicing selling to dow at if. However, we should also have purchased the supply from spinnaker (#144271 bellamy, liz

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin s #745589. And there are three deal out there for csgt #639612, #639615, #745589. The problem is that none of these deals have actuals. It looks as though they have not been nom' d.
Daren are these deals real or what? Why have they not been nom' d? Could they be under another dow company?
Tess, i' m leaving the office for a little bit today. But i' ll be back this afternoon.

Please help! Per dow hydrocarbon' s accountant, marilu trochta' s e - mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what ena billed them and what she reflects in her system. Ena invoice #24636 sa invoiced dow hydrocarbons and resources, inc, on csgt@ b 368 - brazos, per deal number sa 639615,@ 685 per day (3/1/01 - 3/31/01)@ hsc gdp d. A. - $0. 07/mmbtu. Vs. The 18, 457 mmbtu@ $4. 960 that dow has and ena did not invoice them for sales on bluedolphin 250 and 249 vs. The 5, 459 mmbtu@ $4. 960 & 18, 218 mmbtu@ $4. 960 that dow reflects. I realize that the volumes ena billed on the brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the march 2001, sale@ brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale@ blue dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price). Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler (s) are?
Thanks,
Tess
