We will need a small staff to handle potential trades for wed. The 27 th.
Most of the pipelines are out of the office, so I would expect the work load
To be minimal. I plan on coming in, and would like to have a minimum of
Three on staff, so I need two volunteers (one offsystem, just in case). If
Anyone is going to be in town, please forward a number, in case we need to
Call any additional people in, or have you work on a laptop from home. I
Will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss, or, you
Can schedule your day now, I have the calendars. Also, I will be out on
Vacation friday, dec. 22 nd and will need someone to send the nominations to
The plants, I don' t expect to have full system coverage, just hpl/hpl and
Hpl/ena as needed. Let me know if you are interested in learning how to do
This.
Thank you,
Mary
