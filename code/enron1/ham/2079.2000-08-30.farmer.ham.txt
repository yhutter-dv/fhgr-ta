Robert,
You can communicate by lotus notes, phone, memo or other means. The point
That I am making is to communicate
All and any industrial information to daren, gary hanks, volume management,
And myself. There may be times to
Also involve lee and gary as well as others. This was just to assist you.
Thanks, pat

Does it make a difference if the information is communicated via a copy of
Customer" force majeure" letter or should it only be communicated
Via notes mail.
There are several ways to communicate effectively issues that is beneficial
To other departments, do you have a preference?

Deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of january 20. The
Customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned
Turnaround.
It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation
Resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown.
Please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer.
Thanks
