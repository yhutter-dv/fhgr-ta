Subject: guadalupe for 2/27 - - - - intraday
FyI - - - - - - guadalupe had a plant go down today 2/27, and therefore had to get
Some gas off oasis, so they took all 40. 0 from aec back into the aquila
Header, so I moved the deals to reflect this on wgr (aquila header).
Guadalupe deals: 594527 & 578932.
They said there is a chance they will have to do it again tomorrow.
Let me know if you have any questions.
