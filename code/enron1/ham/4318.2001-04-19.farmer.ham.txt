I need help on this one. I spoke to gary shortly after he sent this e - mail the other day. I wasn' t sure what to say in the letter regarding how long they would be shut in - - is there some repair that needs to be done to remedy the situation? Are we ever going to take the gas again? Should I tell them that it will remain shut in until the gas meets our specs?
At gary' s suggestion, I called mike morris & left a message, but haven' t heard back from him. Therefore, I am sending this e - mail to see if anyone else can give me some advise on the contents of the notification letter that I need to send out.
Thanks in advance for any help that you can give me.
