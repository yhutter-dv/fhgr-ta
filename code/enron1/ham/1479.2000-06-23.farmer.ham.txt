Subject: txu at lonestar katy
Hey, I spoke with ronnie skerrik and charlie stone this morning and they
Agreed that
If lonestar does not bring the gas back to hpl as nomed that the gas will
Continue to be
Sold to txu. This should elevate any higher vol re - deliveries/make up to
Hpl.
Please call me with any questions,
Janet
