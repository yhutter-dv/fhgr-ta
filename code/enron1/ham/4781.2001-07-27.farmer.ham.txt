Subject: txu contract search
Anthony,
Daren farmer on the texas desk called me today looking for an active contract that ena has with txu gas distribution (formerly txu lone star gas) dated 11/1/97. I queried global contracts for that cp and didn' t find anything, active or not. Please research all the txu entities to see if you can find a physical contract with ena with that date. Please call daren at x 36905 if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Stacey barclay richardson
