El paso/valero
Hpl - preferred delivery to balance internal systems
Tejas
I spoke with dan burns at el paso yesterday.
He notionally gave me a $0. 04 rate from exxon clear lake
Or comparable source. Seems a bit high.
Hpl quoted us $0. 025 from katy on the marathon refinery
Rfp last week but they wanted $0. 25 for swing transport.
Gary talked to exxon and tejas about sourcing gas into
Crosstex (was cc transmission) at banquette. Exxon
Apparently sells their equity gas at the tailgate of king ranch
Because of recent changes or elimination of their tejas
Transportation agreement/s.
Lets discuss,
