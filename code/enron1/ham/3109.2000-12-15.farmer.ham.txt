Jackie, talk to darren about this. The deal you reference is an hpl deal with
Dynegy and I don' t have access to it. I' m on the east desk. Yesterday i
Extended the deal 421415 for the 6 th and 19 th and meredith inserted a path in
Unify - tetco to cover the small overflow volume between hpl and ena. The
Ena/hpl piece is done. The piece between hpl and dynegy is what you need
Inserted. Thanks

I don' t want to tell you to add any contracts, because I am not sure about
That. I am just saying if you look at ray' s schedule there are 2 deals out
There, one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy. The
Track id I gave you was for ena. You cannot allocate the dynegy piece
Until I give you a track id. I cannot give you a track id until the deal is
Extended for days 10/6 and 10/19.

Arre you saying that for both days that two (2) ena contracts should be
Placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the
Total volume to each contract?

Jackie,
You did not allocate this according to ray' s schedule. The track id I gave
You was only for the purchase from ena. You need to extend the deal for the
Purchase from dynegy. You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena,
That is not what is on ray' s schedule, so we are still out on the
Interconnect report.

Jackie,
Your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10/6 and 10/19 where
Strangers gas is allocated. I have created an accounting arrangement for
These days and the new track id for ena is 240384. Please allocate the ena
Portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days. Deal 422516 (purchase
From dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting
Arrangement. Alfonso I need for you to allocate your meter daily, because
We have tiered pricing this month.
Thanks.
