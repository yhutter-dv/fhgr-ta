Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 for june 2001 from $3, 578, 257. 50 to $3, 559, 472. 93. Our transport expenses went down. We are having some volume problems with this month, so we may need to change it again. I' m trying to keep kyle lilly and jim pond happy on the gl side.
Thanks,
Megan
