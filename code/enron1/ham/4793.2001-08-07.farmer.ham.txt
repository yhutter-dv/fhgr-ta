Subject: glo deals 2001
Darren:
Here is my problem. As you know, hplc did a deal with texas general land office where we would exchange gas for crude. The problem was hplc was selling the gas and enron gas marketing was receiving the crude. Bryce baxter worked out a series of intercompany deals between hplc, ena and egm that would book the deal correctly. Julie meyers was told how to create the deals and she completed january and february, except for one small part, but march forward was never completed. The attached word document explains the procedure. Basically, we were suppose to book an hplc sale to the tglo with volume and zero price. This would book the volume to the gl and zero out the receivable since we were never going to receive cash from tglo. Then, we would book a sale from hplc - wellhead to ena - wellhead for the value of the gas only (no volume) and a sale from ena - wellhead to egm for the value of the crude (no volume). For these deals, we would use demand fees. Egm will pay ena for the crude dollars.
I will give you the deals for january so you can see how the dollars move. You will see that the price is still on the sale from hplc to tglo. Julie zeroed this out, but o' neal put it back. I' ve left him a message to find out why.
