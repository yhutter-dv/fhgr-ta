These are revised schedules for jan, mar, & apr 2000 and the estimate
(scheduled) volumes for may.
The prices were revised to capture texas general storage revenue (fuel
Retention) in jan, mar, & apr. The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy
Price for the storage book.
The april also has volume true - ups due to actual metered volumes. (schedule
6). Another adjustment was made in april to true up the cumulative facility
Balance, (4, 295 mmbtu).
Thanks,
Kenny
