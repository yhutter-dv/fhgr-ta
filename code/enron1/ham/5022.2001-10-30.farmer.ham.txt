Texas a & m football practice was delayed on monday for nearly two hours at kyle field. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery substance on the practice field.
Head coach r. C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while the fbI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the fbI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line.
Practice was resumed when fbI special agents decided that the team would not be likely to encounter the substance again.
