I' m assuming that since this deal is on the new texas desk, and that no new deals have been negotiated under ces counterparties that this deal is actually a truncated deal that was split to move open production from ena - im texas (which I believe no longer exists as part of the post - hpl/aep processes) to ena - im lonestar. The deals have been split several times anderson, bridgette; campos, anthony; gonzales, sharon

I was researching deal 819348 (ces - midcon texas gas services corp) and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract 96035432 (in fact, the gtc firm had three deals attached). Since one of the deals ended 03/31/01, we won' t bother correcting that one, but this deal needs to be moved. I set up contract 96061912 and attached it today. This deal still needs to be reviewed by cyndie before the cp is inactivated.
Elizabeth, could you please revalidate this deal?
My team, could you please add this one to your daily deal count report?
Ellen, could you please reconfirm if necessary?
Thanks, all. Please let me know if you have any questions.
