George,
Please read megan' s e - mail below. The spreadsheet for may did not reflect any nomination for killiam oil. Did the contract with killiam terminate? Should we be purchasing from meter (s) 5427 and/or 6831 and, if so, from what counterparty? Please advise. Thanks.
Bob

Bob:
I need some help with killam oil for may 2001. They called me yesterday
Asking about their may payment because they hadn' t received it yet. I
Looked in path manager and saw that we did not have any deals with them in
May. In april, we paid them for gas at hpl meters 985427 and 986831 (deal
742826 and 742829). The gas at these meters has been put on hpl' s
Strangers gas contract in pops for may. Do you know why we do not have any
Deals at these meters for may? I was told by charles howard that there is
A pending assignment for these meters form hurd to killam. He said for
June 2001, aep paid hurd. Do you know who we are suppose to pay for may?
I would appreciate any help you can give me.
Thanks,
Megan
