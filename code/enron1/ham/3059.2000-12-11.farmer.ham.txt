Subject: 10/2000 - days 6 and 19 (98 - 0439)
The above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to (I guess)
The meter not being turned off in time. The day prior to each of these days
That are assessed to strangers gas, the only active k is the hpl 216.
Can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days?
Thanks
