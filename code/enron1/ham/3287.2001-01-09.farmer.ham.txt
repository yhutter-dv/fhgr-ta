Subject: hpl meter #985892 south katy gas unit no. 2 #1
Daren:
During the month of september and october 2000, gas flowed into hpl' s
Pipeline at the above meter that is owned by duke energy trading and
Marketing, llc. Prior to september 2000, the gas was purchased under
Contract #960439646, and deal #133196 that expired on 8/31/2000. Effective
11/1/2000, the gas was again purchased from duke under contract #96021934;
Deal #466305, but this deal expires on 11/30/2000.
Currently, logistic has september and october 2000 volumes recorded to hpl
Strangers gas contract. In order to correct this, hpl logistics needs either
(1) deals #133196 or #466305 extended to cover september and october 2000,
(2) a new deal to cover september and october 2000, or (3) logistics needs
Approval to write - off these volumes to unaccounted for gas loss. (print,
Sign, and return the original to clem cernosek).
Deal/deal ticket #/ customer (buyer/seller)
Or
Approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
In addition, since deal #466305 expires on 11/30/2000 and gas is still
Flowing, logistics needs either (1) deal #466305 extended, or (2) a new deal
To cover december 2000 and any other future months that this production is
Flowing into hpl' s pipeline.
