Sorry it took me so long to get back to you. Pg & e did not fully process the
Gas stream at their indian springs plant on december 12 and 13 and took the
Reduced shrinkage, 19. 000 mmbtu/d, and sold it to hpl at gas daily - $0. 04.
Pg & e did not have the right to do that, so they are going to allocate that
Volume to comstock, from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month
Index. At the same time pg & e will create an imbalance, for which they will
Pay hpl the same amount hpl paid them for the gas for those two days. This
Should wash the sale at gas daily and leave hpl buying the gas at the
Beginning of the month ifhsc (the price in the comstock purchase contract)
And selling it at the gas daily price for 12/12 and 12/13. The paperwork is
On its way to me to close this issue out.

Jack,
Sandra at teco seems to think you may have some information on how this deal
Should work.

Ed,
Sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal I have attached below.
Apparently we bot from pge industrial on the 12 th and 13 th. Pg & e has
Allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to teco, and claim that they are
Net deals. I do not show a sale in the system at the meter, and I checked
The 215 k for those days for a corresponding delivery to teco, perhaps at
Another meter, and could not find one.
Any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated.
Mary
