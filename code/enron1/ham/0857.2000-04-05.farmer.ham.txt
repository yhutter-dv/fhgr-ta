Subject: deletion of your enrononline user id
Password deletion
It has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar
To their user id' s for internal enrononline applications (stack manager,
Product manager, eol reports).
This is a significant security concern. Therefore, there will be a sweep of
Id' s and passwords at the end of the day on thursday, april 5. Any user id' s
Which have passwords similar to the user id will be subject to deletion.
Changing your password
Passwords can be changed in either the stack manager or in eol reports.
To change your password in the stack manager, once logged on, go to toolbar &
Select" help" and then select" change password".
The system will request you to enter your new password twice.
To change your passsword in eol reports, open the reports application, log
In, select" options" and" change password". The system will request you to
Enter your new password twice. Please note that the password change
Functionality within the reports application is new. If it does not appear on
Your menu and you are running on a standalone machine, you will need to
Logout at the windows level and then login again to receive the updated
Version.
