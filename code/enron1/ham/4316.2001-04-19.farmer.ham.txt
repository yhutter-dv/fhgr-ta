Subject: re: fw: king ranch balancing. Xls
In looking at the mtd prod. Vs. Nom numbers, we have consistently been under nominated by about 2, 000/day at three rivers and 2, 000/day at the saxet well. We are making our imbalance worse, cumulative. We need to update our forward position and our nomination by 4, 000/day to stay in balance to entitlements.
