Subject: txu gas distribution & enbridge consumers gas
Rich & ellen:
We have some problems with the following two counterparties: txu gas distribution & enbridge consumers gas. For txu gas distribution, this is a unconsolidated division of txu gas company and all deals booked under txu gas distribution should be confirmed as txu gas company. I understand this is not the case. For enbridge consumers gas, this is not a valid entity. At some point it will be a correct name, but for now deals should be confirmed and booked under consumers gas co. Ltd.
Each has a relatively recent deal booked to it that need to be changed as described above: sitara 1085609 for txu and 1086002 for enbridge consumers gas.
Please advise if there is something I need to do from my end to get this issue resolved.
Thanks,
Max sonnonstine
