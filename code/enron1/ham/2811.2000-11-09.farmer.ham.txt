Mary jo,
Thanks for the update. Regarding the notice provision of 6 business days
Prior to the close of business on the last business day of the month prior
To selected month, does that mean we need to give you notice for december
By tuesday, november 21 st at 5: 00 pm or monday, november 20 th at 5: 00 pm
Assuming the 23 rd and 24 th are holidays?
John daugherty
