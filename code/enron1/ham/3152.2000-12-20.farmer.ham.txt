We billed wyman gordon 363 mmbtus at $4. 7328 in sept 2000.
I spoke with richard moran at wyman gordon and he indicated that he has not
Had any physical gas deals with us in over a year and does not owe us the
$1, 718. 01 we billed him for september.
Can you please validate if this is his gas or if this deal ticket should have
Been linked to some type of financial deal.
Thanks - katherine
