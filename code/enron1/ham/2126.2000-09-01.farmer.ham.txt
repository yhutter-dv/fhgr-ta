Subject: lone star points
Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created
And the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below.
Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system
(which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would
Create).
Standard pooling stations and west texas (line x) pooling stations had no
Meters, so they are not set up.
The hunt fairway plant (17 - 8477 - 01) was previously created as (178477), i
Need to know if the (01) needs to be added.
We need to verify hpl - texoma (17 - 0973 - 13), it is set up as (17097613). Is
This the same point???
Please let donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red.
Thanks,
Faye
