Send me a request of who you want, and I will make the transaction this
Evening... Expecting that no one ahead of you in the waiver ranking makes a
Bid for the same person. The new player will be available for this weekend
(assuming the games are on!), and you will be dropped to the bottom of the
Waiver ranking system. Remember, you can only pick up 2 per week. Get back
To me when you want!
