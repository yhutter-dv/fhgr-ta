Daren:
On 1/25/2000 the above meter has recorded flow of 18 mmbtus into hpl' s
Pipeline. Currently, the volume is booked to hpl strangers gas contract.
Logistics needs approval to write - off this volume to unaccounted for gas.

Approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
The above meter was a new meter effective 1/1/2000, and therefore, the volume
Flowing into hpl was probably caused by putting the meter in service.
Thanks, clem
