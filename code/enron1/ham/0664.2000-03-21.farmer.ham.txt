This is an outside measured volume that we don' t receive volumes on until
Month' s end so systematically, no information equals zero. Spi, the software
Vendor for mips is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file
Transfers, particularly 0 volumes. The only possible solution is to tag all
Zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as (i) incomplete. I will let
You know the outcome of this investigation and the monies required to
Complete. We may require a work order to complete based on the outcome of the
Investigation.

Jeff/gary,
Where is measurement in the process of sending pipeline operations more
Complete data? We continue to have this problem at various bidirectional
Meters and meter 980071 below is the latest casuality. When mips sends
Pipeline operations a zero prelim, this becomes the best available number and
Overlays the estimate that gas control sends us. When this happens &
Scheduling doesn' t catch to override the zero, the desk' s expense is
Understated. This is causing a huge mess for texas operations. What is the
Plan to move this up on measurements priority list? We need an answer asap!!
Charlotte,
At what other meters are we having this problem?

I spoke with romeo d' souza this morning regarding the on - going problem of
Mips feeding zeros to pops when incomplete data is received.
In light of the e - mail below regarding how important it is that we receive
Accurate data from mips.... Could you please update me on the status of
This correction.
Thank you so much.
Charlotte hawkins

In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that valero texoma
(#71) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3/14 causing an out of balance
At the meter in excess of 500, 000 mm month to date. The more critical part of
This problem, however, is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
Of the hplc deals. This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have
Not been picked up in tom' s p & l and are, instead, sitting in ua 4. To the
Extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value, the p & l may take a
Hit when these actual volumes flow through.
I realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a
Problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it' s discovered.
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
Correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible.
Please give me a call if you have any questions.
