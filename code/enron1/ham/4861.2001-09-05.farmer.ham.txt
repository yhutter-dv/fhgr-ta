Subject: kaf storage project
As requested, this is the summary of what we have discussed regarding kaf deal.
Scenario 1:
Hpl nominates 6, 200 mmbtu/day, apr' 02 - may' 02, (409, 000 mmbtu total) of their south texas production into the kathleen anne field in wilson county, tx. And enron replaces this same volume in the location of their choice.
Scenario 2:
Scenario 1 plus ena sells hpl 500, 000 mmbtu of storage service with an injection rate of approximately 15, 000 mmbtu/day and a withdraw rate of 37, 500 mmbtu/day to help them serve the swing on the tuffco contract.
Notes: the field is not yet connected to hpl, but will be.
Thanks for your help.
