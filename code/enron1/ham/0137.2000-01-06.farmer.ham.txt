Subject: logistics training
Daren,
Thanks for the sitara training class that you taught the logistics group. It
Was extremely valuable
For me and the rest of the group. I appreciate all the time and effort that
You put into setting this up.
The handouts will be great reference material for us in the future. I have
Already heard very positive
Feedback from the group. Very much appreciated. Thanks again, pat clynes
