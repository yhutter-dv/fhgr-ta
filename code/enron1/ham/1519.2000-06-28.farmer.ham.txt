The training will focus on the drill down into the ferc numbers in sap.
The view role is going to be taught with the production system and real
Numbers.
Whomever uses and needs to get these numbers for external reporting will need
This training.
I am going to schedule a 4 hour session for each class.

Cindy, I need to get a list of the people who are going to need ferc
Training for the ena group.
Gpg has sent me a list of people to train but nothing has been planned or
Confirmed.
I would like to schedule the training for the 3 rd week of august after the
July close. I am planning to train the view role
From the production data translated by the module for july. If we can get a
Head count then I can tentatively book
The rooms and equipment to do the training for august.
Thanks
Duane
