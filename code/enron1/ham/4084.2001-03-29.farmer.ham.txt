Oasis will be doing away with the temporary passwords for their on - line nom they are
Encourageing everyone to get on board. Let me know what you want to do. I
Have attached the agreement, and info on the nom/confirm cycles. I have been
Using it this week and it is pretty user friendly. The reporting
Capabilities are still being developed, but I am told it should be ready
Soon. Take a look for yourself@ www. Oasispipeline. Com.......... Logon:
North..... Password: enron........ Currently, no intradays are allowed
Online (only by fax/email) because they want to approve same days, but they
Are looking at allowing them in the future.
