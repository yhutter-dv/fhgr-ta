Subject: meter 1558 april 2001
Cerrito lastiendas - has meter flow on the 7 th and the deal ended on the 6 th. Can we extend the deal for the 48 mmbtu' s that flowed
Or can I override the meter and add it to a day that flowed less than the nom? The third had 4861 and the nom was for 5000.
Thanks - julie
