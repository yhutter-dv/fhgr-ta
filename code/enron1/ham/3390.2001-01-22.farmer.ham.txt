Subject: meter 8022 - bad scada feedback to sitara
Beginning on january 14 th at meter 988022 (united salt), the bav feed into
Pops shows excessive flow (over 200 m/day beginning the 15 th). O' neal brought
This to my attention this evening. This issue will blow out our ua 4 number,
And probably our p & l. I phoned lee in gas control to make sure a tech was
Sent out to check calibration and scada feed. I would like to have better
Estimates from the 14 th through the 19 th asap so that we can make corrections
To all pertinent numbers.
Thank you,
Mary
