Daren,
Hey, sorry about not calling you last thur & frI - I was out sick. I think
That were going to have to play this assistance thing on a day to day basis.
I know I will be catching up for missing those days & I need to get some
Things in order this week for the new guy that starts next week. So i' ll
Just have to call you when I can spare the time. Sorry for any inconvenience
This may have caused you!
Thanks,
Kyle
