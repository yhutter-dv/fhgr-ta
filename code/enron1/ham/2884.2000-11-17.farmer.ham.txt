Subject: meter #6009 - lundell ranch c/p - gato creek
Vance,
It appears the actual volumes have been significantly higher than nominations
At the subject meter the past several months. The following represents
Activity during the months of june through september:
Gas month total nom mmbtu total actual mmbtu
06/2000 19, 680 116, 040
07/2000 19, 933 128, 755
08/2000 19, 530 136, 845
09/2000 18, 540 159, 935
Deal #135708, calpine natural gas company, is the only activity at this
Meter. Should we adjust the nomination to more closely resemble the actual
Volume? Please advise. Thanks.
Bob
