I' m not sure if you got this resolved, but donald will need to have someone
Put a deal in, either a spot or has it been firmed up.

HI julie, I have a question and I wasn' t sure of who to start with. I have a
New meter for c & e operating, meter #0989813 that started up nov. 29. I have
A volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29 th and 30 th, a
Total of 660 mmbtu. The problem is there is nothing in the system for meter #
9813 for 11/99 production. I looked in sitara, (sitara #132030) and the
Deal starts for 12/99 production. I checked with donald to make sure and
He says that the meter did start up 11/29 and the price is hsc less $. 10. In
Order to get this deal into the system, who do I need to talk to???
Thanks, stephanie (3 - 6004)
