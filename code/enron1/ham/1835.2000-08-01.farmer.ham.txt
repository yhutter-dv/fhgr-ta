Subject: resumes sent
I sent you a stack of risk candidate resumes inter - office monday. (steve,
Dutch also received them - spoke with him directly). These candidates
Have not been contacted. Please let me know who looks good for your
Positions to help prioritize the ones we should phone screen.
I also have a stack of out of town resumes that would probably need
Relocation. Let me know if you want to see them.
Thanks
Toni
