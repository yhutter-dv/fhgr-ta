Subject: gulf plains into tennessee for november
I received a call from the plant, apparently, they shorted us 60 dth on the
3 rd of november. However, someone opened the valve on the 20 th and they
Flowed 69 dth into the pipe without a nomination. The plant is asking if we
Will phone tennessee and accept allocation of this volume. I realize that it
Is really not alot of net difference volumetrically, but, the market has been
Volatile and prices have risen significantly since the nov. 3 rd. I also
Don' t know what the market situation is like on tgpl, would we be creating an
Imbalance on a contract, is there a market to allocate to, are there any
Potential penalties? I would like to resolve this today, if at all possible.
Please advise.
