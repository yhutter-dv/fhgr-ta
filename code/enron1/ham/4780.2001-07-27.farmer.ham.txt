Subject: happy birthday!!!
Daren,
I contend that a person should be given their birthday as a paid holiday.
However, I know that the likelihood of your being off work during bid week
Is extremely slim. I hope that you have a great day anyway and a great
Weekend with your precious family. We' ll give you a call this evening or
Over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting (and so sally can sing to
You).
We are so looking forward to seeing you, tonya, cole and jake next weekend.
We' re disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but
Are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to
Come a few days early. We will certainly enjoy our visit with them.
Thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to tonya that you
Are. It gives sally and me such joy seeing tonya highly honored and loved
By you. You are a wonderful father too and it' s so apparent the bond of
Love that you enjoy with your sons. They watch your every move and hang on
Your every word. We' re so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader
Of your family, for being such an outstanding provider for their every need,
And for putting up with the" outlaws". In addition to our friendship, i
Love you as my own son. Again, happy birthday.
David
