I have created deal tickets 241558 and 241560 for july 99 - march 00 based on
The info below. Due to time constraints, I have not researched pricing and
Volumes, I trust that the info supplied to me agrees with the contract.

1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up. The time period for both
Tickets should be july 1999 - forward.
The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of sitara #156337
