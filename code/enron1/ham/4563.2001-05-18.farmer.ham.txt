Subject: texaco 4/01
I have a price discrepancy with one of stacey' s deals with texaco natural gas for april 2001. It is deal 695976 for 12, 000/day. We have it priced at waha gas daily + 0. 005 and texaco says it should be waha if + 0. 005. Rick o' bannion, the trader at texaco, has confirmed their price. Can you check this for me and let me know which is correct?
Thanks,
Megan
