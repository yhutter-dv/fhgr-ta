I set up the accounting arrangement on the hplr transport contract
012 - 64610 - 02 - 052 for january through june per daren' s instructions below.
The tracking id for all 6 months is 34500.
I also set up accounting arrangement on the hplc transport contract
012 - 41500 - 02 - 015 for july per daren' s instructions below. The tracking id
For july is 34501. If you would, please put the transport contract in pops
On monday morning and call me when your done so that I can reallocate the
Meters. I need to call copano to tell them that their payment is on the way.
I need the transport contracts, hplr and hplc put in for all 31 days of each
Of the respective months.
As always thanks in advance for your help,
Fred

Daren:
I looked in path manager and I see two deals - 93480 and 93481, but I don' t
See deal 69176 for july forward that you mentioned below. Also, please
Verify that the deal for january through june is 93481 and if the 69176 deal
Is correct for july forward.
Stella:
I will need to set up accounting arrangements for these deals from january
Forward. From daren' s note below it appears that for january through june i
Will need an hplr transportation contract put in pops. When daren and I get
The deal number issue resolved for july forward I will need an hplc contract
Put into pops. Also for july forward, I will need the hplc contract in pops
Every month through december to allocate copano line gain to if it occurs.
Thanks to both of you,
Fred

Fred,
I have pathed the purchase from copano for 1999 in mops. Jan - jun is under
Hplr (sitara 93481). July forward is under hplc (sitara 69176). I
Understand that I cannot renom this to the pipe for prior months, because the
Callout allocations will be affected. So, you will need to set up accounting
Arrangements to get the nom into pops.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Daren

Daren - fyi. There are deal tickets in sitara to cover this transaction -
#69176 for hplr and #93481 for hplc - but they have zero volume and were not
Pathed in unify. Could you get someone in your group to set these up for
Fred, please? Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

Stella:
I need the above referenced contract put into pops for january, may, june,
July, and august 1999 forward. I need the contract in pops for august
Forward because I never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself.
In 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline/south
Texas, l. P. With a synergI contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
Of 96016880 by karen lambert. Per karen this old agreement was terminated by
Dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect. In 1999, when copano began
Allocating line gain to themselves again I contacted lauri, karen, and
Yourself to see if I could get the contract in pops. Karen sent me an e - mail
Indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
Global #96022367 (I don' t have a" synergi" contract number). I know that in
3/99 laurI contacted bernard widackI at copano to discuss this issue.
I need laurI to review this and then I need the contract to be put in pops so
That I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter. I have not allocated
Any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small. Karen is the most
Knowledgeable about this contract, so I suggest that any questions be
Directed to her regarding contract issues. Karen worked with bernard widacki
At copano to set up the contract originally.
Thanks,
Fred
