Eric bass, texas desk trader, requested the following product described below
Be traded on enrononline. This product will not bridge into sitara and will
Have to be put in manually.
The reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
Stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently,
Enrononline can
Only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
Monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
Cleared out of the monitor.
Since these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that these
Transactions get into sitara as soon as possible. Please read the full
Description below. (this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
Weekends. The" wkd" is short for week days.)
We do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
Prepared to react quickly when they do. For the future, we are looking into
The cost/benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
Dates for these types of products.
If you have any questions, please call me at 3 - 5824
Thank you.

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow,
May 24 th.
The product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
Desk. It will be identified as follows:
Us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd/mm
This product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
That the product description has an
Indicator of wkd, which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
That is a monday, tuesday, wednesday,
Thursday or friday.
These products will not bridge into sitara. Risk personnel will need to be
Diligent to identify these products based
On the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
Entered into sitara correctly (presumably -
Strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
And/or month - ending days).
We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
Transactions and have asked the appropriate
Systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
Building bridge capability. In the
Interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low,
And will ask for higher prioritization of the
Bridging in the event that volumes increase.
