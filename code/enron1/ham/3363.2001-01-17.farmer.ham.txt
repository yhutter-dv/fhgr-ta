Subject: ranks communication
After getting your imput, I think this is the best:
We will only communicate needs improvement and issues. There will be
Differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need
To hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to
Peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a
Bonus (may need to finda another role within or outside enron which is a
Better fit). Message to someone new to enron in that category should be
Different. Glad they are here: believe that as they learn the organization
And their job that they will be able to make significant contribution: doing
The right thing to learn business, but that contributions to date are not
Significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus.
Let me know what you think.
Thanks
Bob
