Subject: daren,
I was wondering if it would be ok for me to sit in with you one day to get a
General feel of your end of the process. Pat had told me before he left that
It would help me better grasp the process as a whole.
I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not
Be the best time to be in your way. But let me know if I can spend a day,
Morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good
Time. I think it will help me very much in my role.
Thanks.
Mike
