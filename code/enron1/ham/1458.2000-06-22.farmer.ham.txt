Subject: note from ken seaman
Hi,
?
How is the family???? And the multiple jobs??????
?
We just got back from omaha - - - linda' s 40 th high school reunion. I wish
Someone would explain to me who all those old people were that attended.
?
Putting $1. 85 a gallon gas in that beast of hers was sure fun. I may need a
Part - time job if this keeps up long. (just kidding - - you probably have
Enough to deal with - - right)
?
Jennifer has decided to journey off to law school at baylor. She and linda
Are going to waco friday to finalize an apartment.
Chris is managing the I - 10 texas land & cattle store. Keeps him very busy.
(can' t even send an e - mail - - - - - like someone else I know) (just kidding)
?
We are looking for property on a lake (linda' s request). Like there is
Anything like that left in texas. We will probably drop in this house.
?
Pretty quiet here all things considered.
?
Drop me a line or give me a call when you have some time. Or if you are
Really free we could actually plan a lunch. The price of natural gas should
Help keep tom from hassling you too much.
?
