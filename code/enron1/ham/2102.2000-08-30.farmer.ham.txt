As part of an effort to facilitate communication on the trading floor, we
Have set everyone up with microsoft messenger.
For those of you not familiar with the program, microsoft messenger allows
You to talk real time with anyone on your contact
List. The program also has voice capabilities if you have a microphone.
Messenger should now be fully installed on your
Computer and is accessible from the start menu.
You will need to set up a hotmail account in order to use this service.
Please follow the link below to set up your account.
Once you have created an id, please email me back with your id so that I can
Compile a contact list for everyone on the floor.
Let me know if you need help getting set up.

A word of caution when using the program. Because this is not behind the
Company firewall, anything you send is not 100% secure and
Could be intercepted by a third party. Any sensitive pricing information
That you do not want disclosed should not be transmitted over
The program.
