That sounds great. Because of the accrual, I cannot draft this today. I
Will try it on monday. What about the demand fee for the payable to tenaska
Iv. Do you think that is a good idea? I explained it to kris hanson and she
Agreed that it was the best way to book this payable. We would need a new
Demand purchase ticket for tenaska iv on the cleburne desk in the amount of
$2, 803, 586. 41 with no volume and no commodity. This is more than we owe
Tenaska iv, but I will net it with the tenaska iv sale and the $0. 04 demand
Fee to pay a net amount of $1, 551, 050. 76. I have attached my spreadsheet
Which details our payment. We will have to adjust this number once we get
The actual volumes. I would like to pay tenaska iv next week, so please let
Me what you think.
Thanks,
Megan
