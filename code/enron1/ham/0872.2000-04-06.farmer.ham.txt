Changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
To any downstream processes.
I hope the following will give more clarification.
Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail!
Thanks,
Dg 3 - 9517
Sitara/unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
Been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from unify.
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management, absolutely
Harmless. Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* process -
Counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b.
Ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline.
The new name (ctprty b) does bridge over to unify.
Ctprty a remains at the path level in unify (guI display does not change)
Ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify. The field is now
Highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (guI display changes only at high
Level, not on path)
The scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re - path
If re - pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara (where all
Information is correct)
Volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out.
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
Up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in unify.
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which
Would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re - draft would occur.
(note: there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now)
Autonoms" tom' s words of warning" -
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
Deals were pathed and nominated. Basically it would change a key on an edi
Path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already
Nominated to the pipeline. If the scheduler re - nominated, data at the
Pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
The problem. In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
Manually cut the original nominated volume. This is not an issue with unify
(as explained above).

Fyi....
This change went in for the deal validation group. It gives them the
Ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.
Impact to logistics - unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
Backed, it could cause problems on edI pipes as that new counterparty name
Will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the imbalance data sets, which are not in production
Yet...... (edI imbalance qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where
Nominations were sent for entire month)
Can' t remember the rules on this one, but I think unify does have some safe
Guards (idiot proofs) to force re - pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers, yet would still cause
An additional step for edI the scheduler would need to think through in order
To get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
Place? (prior periods? Re - pathing?)
I have a call into diane and dave both. After speaking w/them, hopefully i
Can get a clear understanding of the true impact. I am sure we' ll need to
Put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
These type of changes are needed.
Will keep you posted.
Thanks,

Subject: sitara release (re: changes in global due to consent to assignment)
Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
Confirmed volumes - tom' s words of caution:
If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
Ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
Then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:
" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
Pipeline allows this change."
Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
Feedback - I assume for the same reasons
We had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
(pre - unify). Some pipelines will require a new
Deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.
Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
In case it causes problems with their
Pipeline. Sorry - I don' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
The unify team.
There is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
Market east - but not from
Ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
The same legal entity.
" warning - not the same legal entity"
Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
(transport capacity, storage, cash out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules. Don' t forget - the items
Were locked down for a reason.
If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
Data that was validated - and someone used these
Deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
Using these deals will get corrupted. Always check
With someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
Unify.

Subject: sitara release (re: changes in global due to consent to assignment)
With the release that was put out tuesday evening, deal validation should be
Able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
Than expected (e. G. Confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).
In addition, this release will also capture" near - time" the contract changes
That are made in global. This means that need for server bounces will not be
Necessary.
New/changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
Manager.
New counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out
Of all active sitara apps (except for launch pad).
Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you
Are looking for will appear.
I mention" near - time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
Takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
Updates its information
