Subject: global octane meter #: 1528 july 2000 activity
Lee informed me today {7/12 th} that global octane has experience
" operational" problems beginning last night and will be down until further
Notice.
Note: this outage is considered" force majeure" thus, whatever flows
During this time period should be allocated to the" term" deal.
Lee was very specific toward this issue not being a buyback.
Howard, please forward this information to whomever need it in
Settlement.... Thanks.
