Mary,
Hplc executed a gas purchase agreement with ccgm, lp effective 7/1/2000.
Hplc secured the purchase of production from the briscoe #1 well in webb
County for 12 months; the producer of this well is hoover oil however,
Did not do so for the month of november.
Hopefully this is useful information!

Fred:
I have run this issue by clem cernosek for further research, and expect to
Have his answer this afternoon. In the meantime, it is my understanding that
This well is behind the big cowboy system. At this time, we have deal ticket
380710, purchase from ccgm, l. P. On hplc/hplc. This deal should probably be
On gulf energy/bigcowboy. The producer, as I understand it, is acock
Production, however, I may be mis - informed. Any insight which any of you can
Shed on this deal would be very welcome, I would like to capture this
Accurately and definitively as early on as possible, so as to prevent any
Future issues.
Thank you all for your patience and assistance,
Mary
