Subject: hpl meter #985579
Gary:
Hpl received volumes at the above meter during 1/1/99 thru 6/99. Prior to
1/1/99, ena was purchasing some of the volumes from I p petroleum under
Contract #016 - 44386 - 102; deal #341832. This deal expired 12/31/99, but the
Volumes continued to flow and be allocated to I p petroleum by pioneer.
Since there was no deal to cover these volumes, these volumes were allocated
To hpl strangers gas contract.
Volume mgmt had previously requested a deal to cover these volumes from
Someone, but never received one.
Here are the months and volumes that need resolution:
Prod. Mth mmbtus
Jan. 99 6, 510
Feb. 99 6, 395
Mar. 99 14, 789
Apr. 99 16, 866
May. 99 8, 415
Jun. 99 13, 858
Total 66, 833
Possible solution:
1. Need a deal to cover the periods in question, or
2. Provide authorization to writeoff the volumes. (print & return original
To clem cernosek)
Approval to writeoff the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
Ps: my understanding is that neither I p petroleum nor pioneer have
Addressed any issues concerning these volumes.
