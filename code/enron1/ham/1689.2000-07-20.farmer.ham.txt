Team,
As I mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
Entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
Position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market. Our
Primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
Achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
Pipelines. I would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
Optimal course of action for hpl and for enron.
The skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
Upstream origination business in n. America, as well as to the ongoing
Operation of hpl. Our origination strategy is to leverage our business
Operations, field operations, engineering, producer services, and marketing
Skills to capture value from transportation, gathering, storage and commodity
Opportunities on the gas/power grids. We need our current employees to
Accomplish this objective across n. America.
We have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
Powder/wind river pipelines, installing electric compressors, contracting for
Processing capacity, and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
Gulf coast. Our recent efforts to provide services such as business
Operations, measurement, trading/marketing, and accounting services to third
Party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity.
It is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
Competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
Matters with third parties. Please come see me if you have any specific
Questions or concerns. Also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
Hpl to tim determing.
Regards,
Brian
