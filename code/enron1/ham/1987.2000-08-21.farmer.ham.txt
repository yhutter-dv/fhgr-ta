Conoco has nominated 5. 0/d at this meter. Conoco transport can be allocated
The entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow
Exceed 5. 0 mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter.
Hpl may also be able to extract a sell for this overage which is why i
Wanted you to be aware of the daily activity thus far.
