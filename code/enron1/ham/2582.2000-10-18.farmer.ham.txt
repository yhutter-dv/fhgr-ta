Subject: suemar berryman; gulf plains plant for current month
Daren,
As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the berryman well for
Oct, which in turn affects our volumes at the gulf plains plant. From a
Physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced. My concern is
That we are" overproduced" on paper by 76, 162 dth/mo. I think that we need
To bring the nominations up to balance in sitara at the berryman well and, a
Corresponding volume at meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on strangers to
Keep the physical side in line. If my understanding is correct (and if not,
Please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month
Ua 4.
Thank you,
Mary
