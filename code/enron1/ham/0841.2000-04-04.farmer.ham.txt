Subject: issues with measurement (gary anderson' s group)
It seems to me that there have been several issues recently involving data
Feeds from measurement. Regardless of the issue, you all seem to express the
Same concern: a lack of accountability, no sense of urgency.....
I brought this up in brian' s staff meeting yesterday, in hopes to get some
Ideas on where to go to get some results. Rita, I understaood from you that
Gary has returned your call and you are setting a meeting for later this
Week. Please include me in the meeting. If we don' t get what we need, it
Was recommended that I talk with ellis sturn. If that doesn' t work, brian
Will talk with rod hayslett. Rita: prior to the meeting, would you please
Coordinate the meeting and agenda, consolidating all issues/concerns? Yvette
Can set the meeting.
