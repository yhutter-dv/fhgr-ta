Subject: meter 981318
Daren,
The above meter recorded a flow on jan 15 this year. It has not had any
Activity all the way back through 1999. I checked with cheryl jones and the
Flow is good. It was apparently turned on for that one day. Do we need to
Put in a deal for this flow?
Thanks.
Also, we had a transport nom from texaco into king ranch, so we will have
Adequate flow into stratton.
