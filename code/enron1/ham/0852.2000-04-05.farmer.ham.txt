Subject: your mom
Remember me? I' m the one who loved you so much that I gave my very best at
Raising you. And now i' m missing you so much. Lacy & I can' t understand why
You don' t call to check on us & just to talk a while - - it doesn' t count that
Tonya calls - - I didn' t raise her. We want to hear your voice every once in a
While. I know you work a lot, but you used to find time once a week. And
That' s no excuse. You can schedule in a call to us. We' re still your family
Too. We love you, ma
