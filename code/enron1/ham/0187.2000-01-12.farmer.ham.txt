For days 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 28, we are short at the aggregate
Meter. Should the reliant transport and sales or do we charge reliant a
Penalty?
Also, I notice that at meter 1554 we have 3 rd party transport this month.
This look strange because i' ve not seen them here before.
Please advice.
Thanks
