Subject: pipelines that still have dial in access for nominations
Following are the responses I received to the question: please ask your schedulers to e - mail me which pipelines still maintain the ability to do nominations via a dial up connection to their ebb (modem and a phone line).
Please ask them to call their representatives if unsure.
