Deal #157288
Location: centana
Days: 3/11 - 3/31 (gas is not a part of the exchange agreement).
I need to have the spot deal placed on a different deal ticket than the
Exchange deal (#157288).
Will you break out this spot deal separately?
Thanks for fixing the price for the etxg gas system in march.

Have you had a chance to change the pricing in the system?
Duke has called me several times they want to get our march deals finalized.
I am not sure what I should tell them.

Deal #157288
Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. Separate the centena term deal
From the spot deal in sitara for march 2000 production.
Also, I need to have the price for the east texas redelivery changed in
Sitara from hs index $-. 085 to hs index $-. 0825. This is per the contract
The price for this redelivery point.
Thanks
