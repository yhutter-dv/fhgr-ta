This is a reduction in total capacity from 528, 000 to 400, 000 at station 809.
Hpl has typically been running about 180, 000 to 200, 000 mmbtu through station
809 in august. We can pull more gas off of the a - s line at swan lake to keep
Our throughput around the 175, 000.
My original conversation with epfs was that the capacity would be limited to
Around 400, 000 mmbtu total during the maintenance. Station 809 will be down
Through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move
Without 809 running. I will visit with epfs on monday and see if we can get
The volume bumped up (to 400, 000) and adjust on tuesday as necessary.
If you have any questions please call. 36449.

Station 809 has scheduled maintenance on their lb solar centaur turbine for
The three gas flow days of august 15, 16 & 17, 2000. During this
Maintenance the 2 reciprocating engines will be operating. The estimated
Capacity through station 809 during this time is approximately 350, 000
Mmbtu. Both owners are entitled to 1/2 of this capacity (175, 000 mmbtu) &
Should schedule accordingly.
Contact me if you have any questions.
