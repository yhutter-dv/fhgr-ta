Sherlyn,
Per our conversation earlier today, I need an accounting arrangement set up
For meter #980072 for the month of january so I can move the volumes from the
Stranger' s gas contract over to the hpl 215 contract. Please let me know if
You have any questions. Thanks, susan.

Daren,
On january 15 and 16, hpl bought some gas from western gas resources at the
Aquila header (10. 000 and 5. 000 mmbtu' s respectively). This was a late
Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in pops, the gas was scheduled
On the stranger' s gas contract. However, deal ticket #143709 was never
Updated to reflect those late changes. Please let me know if you want me to
Update the deal ticket. Thanks, susan.
