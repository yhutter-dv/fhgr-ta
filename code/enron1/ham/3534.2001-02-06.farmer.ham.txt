I checked with ken reisz with tenaska iv this afternoon re: maintenance being
Completed, and at this point they are still on track to come back up on the
9 th sometime...... However, he did say that they have not gotten a look at
Everything just yet, but expect to have a better idea as to their downtime in
The morning. He said he would call mary with the latest news. Mary, please
Check with him on thursday to see where they are at, at if we need to nom gas
To lonestar or not.
Thanks,
Mark
