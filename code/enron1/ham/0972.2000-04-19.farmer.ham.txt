HeidI - there should be a deal ticket in sitara for this sale to engage, but
It looks as though 12/99 was the last month a deal was entered
(if/hsc + 1. 00). George/craig - could you guys coordinate who should be rolling
This deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing? HeidI -
Historically we' ve been charging $. 60/mm for this transport.

I am finding flow out there on hpl 215 for meter 1520 (tx city coastal
States) starting 4/1/00 (actually, no volume was scheduled but looks like it
Has been allocated since march 1). Did you want a premium rate for this?
