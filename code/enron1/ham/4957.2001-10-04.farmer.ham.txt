"... If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and
Pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear
From heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land." - 2
Chronicles 7: 14
Bryant gumbel recently interviewed billy graham' s daughter.
Gumbel:" why didn' t god stop this or do something about this?"
Billy graham' s daughter:" for years we have told god we didn' t want
Him in our schools. We didn' t want him in our government and we
Didn' t want him in our finances and god was being a perfect gentleman in
Doing just what we asked him to do. We need to make up our mind - do
We want god or do we not want him. We cannot just ask him in when
Disaster strikes."
Bryant gumbel was silent.
