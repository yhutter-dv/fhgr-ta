Subject: parking
For prior periods - I am not sure if you need to handle this using the
Instructions below - or if for prior months only - if you would be allowed
To create a
Cashout ticket to clear out any prior period imbalances. Your controller
And volume management (kathy kelly) should make this call.
Kim and david can brain check me on this - but I think this is how parking
Should be done; however,
Please verify with west or east desk economics to ensure accuracy/consistency.
Parking procedures
Create a storage deal in sitara - service type: parking
Use this service deal to path to a storage account in unify - this way you
Have accounted for the gas in unify
Inject into storage account
Withdrawal from storage account
(when you do the opposite of parking - withdrawal first - it is called a
" loan")
Create two economic deals in sitara - exchange deal
Create an internal buy and sell of physical gas for economics and position
Purposes - (no invoices - fake 3 rd party)
Exchange deal -
Sell to cpr pipeline exchange (parking gas)
Buy from cpr pipeline exchange (getting gas back)
Within the month parking - no money exchanges hands - except any service fees
Which can be recorded on the storage deal.
Sell to cpr pipeline exchange (parking gas) - price = $0
Buy from cpr pipeline exchange (getting gas back) price = $0
When the deal crosses a month - if you keep the risk within the desk - in the
Short term you record a big loss - sell at $0 - and the
Next month you record a big gain - buy at $0. To manage this - usually the
Cash desk swaps out the time risk to a storage financial book - who will pick
Up the time
Spread loss and offsetting gain - as this book captures forward value.
When you are adjusting your physical injections (parking) within the month -
You will need to
Adjust your swaps too - which will adjust the p & l for the time spread
Accordingly - otherwise you will have liquidation problems.
Period 1 - sell to cpr pipeline exchange (parking gas) - price = $0 swap
To firm book for index + mid
Period 2 - buy from cpr pipeline exchange (getting gas back) price = $0
Swap to firm book for index + mid
