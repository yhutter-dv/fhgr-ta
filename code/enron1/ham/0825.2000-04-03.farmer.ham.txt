Subject: king ranch
Stella,
It is very important that king ranch is accurately scheduled in the
System. Sitara should be updated
With any changes so that daren can properly manage the texas desk position.
Hopefully we have moved
Enough off of your desk to allow you to concentrate on king ranch. Too many
Discrepancies have been made
And it is very costly to the desk. Robert can assist if needed.
Thanks, pat
