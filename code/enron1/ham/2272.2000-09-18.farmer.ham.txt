Subject: hpl curtailment plan
We are going to be reviewing the hpl curtailment plan, with the ultimate
Issue being how does hpl best structure its curtailment program to comply
With regulatory requirements and to best suit hpl , s business purposes.
Attached is a memo meant to provide a brief summary about what a curtailment
Plan is and some of its ramifications. We , ll be setting up a meeting soon
To discuss the issues surrounding the curtailment regulations and their
Significance to hpl. Certainly there will be critical legal, regulatory,
Commercial, operational, gas control, accounting, and even public relation
Issues to be considered in this deliberation. Whatever the decision may be
As to what to do, we must also determine how to find out relevant facts,
Establish the processes to be followed, and perform the necessary procedures
To implement our action plan.
