Each month at seven oaks, teco (pg meter no.: 6884
Greg, this relates to the seven oaks tailgate accounting issue we have been
Discussing. Hplr once had an appropriate agreement in place, but that
Agreement has been assigned to ect. Until the agreement can be re - assigned
From ect to hplc, we will use spot gtcs to clear the puchase/sale accounts
For the period from 10/98 to 6/99 or perhaps 7/99.

Enron capital meter no.: 6884
Julie,
In 1996, a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing,
Contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101/078 - 86978 - 301. In april' 99, these contracts
Were assigned to ect. In october of 1998, these contracts should have been
Assigned to hplc, but did not get assigned. Beginning in jan.' 99, negative
Volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
#18372 (meter #6884), causing my payments to be reduced. I believe that the
Deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract. (the
Purchase deal numbers which I have been using are sitara #14086 and sitara
#11079). Both these sales and purchases (since october' 98) are suppose to
Be for hplc. Donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc' s
Between teco and hplc can be set up from october of 1998 until the master
Contract is changed. Amelia alland has set these up, which I believe
Terminate in october' 99. The gtc spot contract numbers are as follows:
Purchases: 012 - 86978 - 102; global 96021450
Sales: 012 - 86978 - 301; global 96021451
Per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments?
When complete, can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be?
Thank you so much for your help and let me know if you need additional
Information.
