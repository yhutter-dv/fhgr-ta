Bad news..... The cleburne imbalance is out of control. You might want to start some payback to lonestar. Lonestar' s estimates for the accumulative imbalance at the beginning of may was 140. 0 due them, now I guess their actuals came in and now at the beginning of may shows 214. 0 due them. I am waiting to hear back from lisa with lonestar to see why there is such a big discrepancy. Through the 16 th, her updated estimates reflect an imbalance of 240. 0 due them.... The plant continues to overpull, our nom to the plant which is not all 45. 0 due to brazos' take.
Let me know what you want to do.
