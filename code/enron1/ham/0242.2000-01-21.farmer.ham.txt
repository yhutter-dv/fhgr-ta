Ok, it looks like we are going with the no deal situation. I will zero out
The buyback and the sale for the next 2 weeks. Let me know if you want to
Handle it differently.

I have requested a force majeure letter from valero and they wanted to know
What exact language should be in this letter. Dan, can you give me some
Guidance that I can directly forward to valero.

The plant went down at 0001 hrs this morning. My information is they moved
Their turnaround up and will be down for as long as 3 weeks. Please let us
Know how the economics should be handled - - - - buyback, force majure, no deal,
Or what.
Thanks
