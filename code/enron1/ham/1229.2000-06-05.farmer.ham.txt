Subject: performance feedback
Each of you have been chosen by one or more of my direct reports to provide
Mid - year feedback. I just wanted to urge you to provide this to me asap, as
My prc meeting wil be 6/13, even though the feedback system is open through
6/16. Therefore, I need your feedback by friday, 6/9 so that I can use the
Week - end to get ready. Although I would prefer the feedback through the
System, if you are finding yourself in a bind for time, please provide me
Your feedback verbally either through voicemail (mark it private) or I would
Be happy to meet with you.
I know we all receive many of these requests, but I sincerely appreciate
Constructive feedback. Thanks in advance for your input!
