Subject: 6/00 production for lower colorado river authority, sitara #283939
Daren,
Mary gregg from lcra said that sitara #283939 should have been for
$4. 50/mmbtu. Currently in deal manager - sitara, it is at $2. 50 and that is
The price that I billed them at. Please verify the price and let me know
What you find out.
If you have any question, please, call me.
Thank you in advance for your help.
