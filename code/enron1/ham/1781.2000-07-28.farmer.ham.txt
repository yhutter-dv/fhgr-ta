Panenergy purchase: deal #231758.
Gas in the amount of 271 mmbtus for april lst was purchased from panenergy on
Deal #231758.
However, scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day
One and as a result, it is not pathed in the system.
Could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn' t be a sale
So that scheduling can either path april lst or I can dispute the volume
Being billed to us by pan energy.
This is part of pan energy' s exchange deal.

As I told thu before (see below), I did not see any volumes for that deal
In 4/00. I think this volume is some residue that flow from the last day in
March and probably should be allocated to that month. I dont show a deal to
Purchase or sell that gas in april. If you have any more questions please let
Me know, thanks.

Katherine,
This is a brokered deal (buy deal 231758 and sell deal 93472). This first
Day was not pathed, that' s why you are missing volume of 271. Per carlos
(see below) the deal was not for day one.
