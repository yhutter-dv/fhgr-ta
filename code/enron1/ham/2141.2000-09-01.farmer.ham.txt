I spoke with brian nichols about the august preliminary invoice. There
Appears to be a problem for august 28 & 29 - the volumes are much too low.
Either there were deliveries off of centana that we are missing, or there is
A problem with the hpl data. I am having brain fade and cannot remember the
Name of the person in the measurement department to contact, so maybe you
Could look into this and have it corrected.
Thanks
Lee
