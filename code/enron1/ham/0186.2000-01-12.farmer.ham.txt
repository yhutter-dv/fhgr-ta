Subject: calpine force majeure - dec 99
HI daren,
I spoke with ricky archer at calpine about some penalty charges I billed him
For undertakes on dec 20, 21, 31.
He said force majeure letters were sent to your attention.
If you have them, would you have someone fax a copy of those letters to met
At 713 - 646 - 8420?
Do you have any other information on the force majure or should I speak with
Jennifer?
Thanks for your help!
