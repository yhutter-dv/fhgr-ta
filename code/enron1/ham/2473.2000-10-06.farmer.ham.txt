Cashout for 8/00 was $118, 103. 67. Your pricing took care of most of the
Cashout, but there was still a balance. The over delivery pricing per mmbtu
In the contract is the difference between hsc spot - 0. 05 and hsc index, so
Gd - 0. 10 didn' t quite cover the entire cashout. I have attached the calc
Sheet in case you need it.
