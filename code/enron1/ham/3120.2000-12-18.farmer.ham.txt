Subject: deliveries into channel at gulf plains
Duke is calling regarding the volumes we are delivering into channel at the
Gulf plains plant. Apparently, we are half of the volumes delivered at the
Meter and channel is pressuring the plant back. Duke has asked if we will
Take the additional gas which is" undeliverable", I think we may need to
Move our markets to another meter, ie. Hpl/agua. Please advise.
