First of the month industrials are coming along fine. I will finalize my
Pathing tomorrow, thursday, and set up buybacks and swings by the
End of day friday.
The industrial" buyback & deficiency deals" worksheet has captured the
Necessary data to help gas control & the on - call scheduler as well as
Myself and client services.
I will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day friday.
I am on vacation during the week of july 5 th thru july 10 th.
Enron north america corp.

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for july? I am a little
Concerned with the long weekend coming up. I believe that we agreed that
These would be set up by the 3 rd work day, which would be friday the 7 th.
(six days of flow.) I definitely don' t think that we should any later. It
Would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.
Additionally, we need to get the industrial spreadsheet up and running
Again. This report is very beneficial to gas control, industrial traders and
Schedulers on call.
Let me know what you think.
